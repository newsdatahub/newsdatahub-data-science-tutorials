            "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeaways RAM allows computers run fast and optimally. 16GB is now the standard for PCs and laptops. Heavy users may need more RAM. Know when to upgrade. I used to struggle when shopping for a new computer -- there's a lot to keep in mind. Over time, I learned to narrow it down to what I call the \"performance trifecta\" -- three main components you should be mindful of: processor, storage drive, and RAM. A good processor is the brains of the computer, and a lot of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files. Also: You're cleaning your desktop PC wrong: 8 cheap and easy ways to maintaining it But what about memory? It's a component many people fully understand (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access, resulting in faster performance. The higher the RAM (measured in Gigabytes, or GB) the more memory it has. There's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get. How much RAM do you need in 2025? The short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos. But let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience. Also: Why I'd choose this HP Windows laptop over a MacBook for work especially at its latest price If you're upgrading to Windows 11, Microsoft says the minimum requirements are 4GB of RAM, but I'd still recommend 16GB as the baseline standard. If you have more than that, even better, but for most PCs, Windows 11 should run about the same as older operating systems. When it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until only recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4. MacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest). Besides just Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their average lower price and lightweight operating system: ChromeOS. I did the math, and here's my expert advice Because ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chomebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows. All in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment because you end up spending money on a resource that you hardly ever use to its fullest extent. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms. When buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way you can make a realistic expectation about how much RAM you need. What does DDR5 mean? Sometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters \"DDR\" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for \"double data rate.\" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5. Similar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices. Don't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a standard for computers. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen. Want more laptop advice? Add ZDNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers. When should you upgrade? 16GB is fine for most cases, although if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider opting for 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video-editing apps you use for work operate more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write. I also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM. Also: I recommend this older Windows 11 laptop over some newer models here's why.",

            "content": "STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) Authorities in California appealed to the public for tips, even rumors, as they searched Sunday for a suspect in the killing of three children and an adult during a mass shooting at a child’s birthday party in Stockton. “It’s heartbreaking,” said Heather Brent, a spokesperson for the San Joaquin County sheriff’s office. She said investigators believe it was a “targeted incident” at a banquet hall where 100 people or more had gathered Saturday night. Brent said the deceased were ages 8, 9, 14 and 21. Eleven people were also wounded. No one was in custody by Sunday afternoon, and she did not elaborate on why authorities believe it was intentional or who might have been targeted. “If you have surveillance footage, if you’re a local business here, if you’re in the area, live in the area, or maybe you’ve heard rumors please contact the sheriff’s office,” Brent said. She said she could not release information about a motive or details about a suspect, noting that it might hinder the investigation. “Finding the person or persons who committed this crime is the No. 1 priority,” Brent said. Faith leaders in Stockton were planning an afternoon vigil to honor the dead and pray for the wounded. The shooting occurred just before 6 p. m. Saturday inside the hall, which shares a parking lot with other businesses. Stockton is a city of 320, 000 residents, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Sacramento. “This was a birthday party for a young child, and the fact that this happened is absolutely heartbreaking,” Brent told reporters. District Attorney Ron Freitas urged the shooter to “turn yourself in immediately.” Mayor Christina Fugazi told reporters on Sunday that the 8-year-old victim attended a local school and had a parent who worked for the Stockton Unified School District. The mayor said counselors would be available this week at city schools. Community leaders expressed anguish over the loss of victims so young. “They should be writing their Christmas lists right now. Their parents should be out shopping for them for Christmas. And to think that their lives are over. I can’t even begin to imagine what these families are going through. Breaks my heart,” Fugazi said. In 2024, Stockton had many more homicides 54 than other California cities of similar size, but the rate was down through October of this year, according to city data. Fugazi on Saturday recalled a shooting several years ago in which “seven people were gunned down” in the city. “Stockton is better than this. Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive,” Fugazi said. ____ Weber reported from Los Angeles. Associated Press writer Ed White in Detroit contributed to this report. ( ).",

The first strike was very lethal. It was fine,” the president said.

            "content": "The Houston Texans notched a critical victory in Week 13, downing the Indianapolis Colts in a 20-16 affair to move to 7-5 on the season, and they garnered attention multiple times from injured running back Joe Mixon. Mixon is on the Reserve/Non-Football Injury (NFI) list with an undisclosed ankle and/or foot issue that is expected to keep him sidelined for the remainder of the season. However, Mixon has and remains engaged in what the Texans are doing. Joe Mixon Praises Nico Collins It was C. J. Stroud’s first game back under center after a three-game concussion-related absence, which made Nico Collins happy. However, Mixon’s first message came in the fourth quarter, as Collins took an end-around 7 yards into the end zone, tying the game at 13-all. “Love to see it 12 [praying hands emoji],” Mixon posted on X after the score. Collins, who also had 98 yards on five receptions, spoke candidly about the win and the score, telling NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero that the win was “Major. It was a big win, man. We know it was a division team, man. The Colts, one hell of a team, and they playing great. And we know on the road, we had to come and bring it, man. So, man, proud of this team. I’m glad we fought all four quarters, man. It’s not an easy team to beat, man, but I’m glad we got the dub. “I’m glad I’m a dawg back, man. You only get one brain, man. We got to take care of that. But I’m glad he’s healthy, I’m glad he’s back doing what he loved, and I’m glad we got to win.” Collins is now up to 57 receptions for 795 yards. He is stuck on 4 receiving TDs, having last found paydirt through the air in Week 11. However, the rushing score was a career first for the 2024 Pro Bowler. “I’ve been waiting on it,” Collins told Pelissero. “The team trusts me to get to get in the end zone, man. Once I got the opportunity, I had to get in there. I felt like Woody [Marks] back there. I had to go, man. Just get in the end zone. But, man, I’m glad we got the dub, I’m glad I got in the paint, and most importantly, I’m proud of this team.” Joe Mixon Puts Bow on Texans’ Win Over Colts The Texans, who have missed Mixon, ranked 23rd in rushing offense entering Week 13. But they have found a way, and the two-time Pro Bowler let it be known that they had vanquished their AFC South rivals, the Colts, in Week 13. “BALLGAME,” Mixon said in another post. Mixon’s celebrations of the team’s renewed success will not replace his presence on the football field. It is, however, a telling note given the uncertainty around Mixon’s future with the Texans. He is signed through the 2026 season. Texans general manager Nick Caserio could still opt to part ways with the former Cincinnati Bengals star this coming offseason if there remains no further clarity on his health. For now, Mixon is a member of the Texans, if only in association, and is dialed in as Collins, Stroud, and their stellar defense lead the charge.",

In a late-night Thanksgiving message, following the terrorist ambush by a Biden illegal from Afghanistan against two West Virginia National Guardsmen in Washington, DC, which killed one and critically injured the other, Trump went off on the unvetted immigration crisis and the “retarded” leftist politicians like Tim Walz. During an Air Force One press gaggle, a reporter accused Trump of using an “offensive term” and whether or not he stands by the use. WATCH: Reporter: in that same post, you mentioned Tim Walz and you called him what many Americans do find an offensive term: Retarded. Do you stand by that claim of calling Tim Walz retarded? Trump: Yeah I think there’s something wrong with him, absolutely. Sure. You have a problem with it? You know what? I think there’s something wrong with him. Anybody that would do what he did, anybody that would allow those people into his state and pay billions of dollars out to Somalia- we give billions of dollars to Somalia. It’s not even a country because it doesn’t function like a country. It’s got a name but it doesn’t function like a country. Yeah there’s something wrong with Walz. As The Gateway Pundit reported, Walz responded to Trump calling him “the seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota,” telling Kristen Welker on Sunday that he wears it as a “badge of honor.” MORE:.",

            "content": "An actress of many talents, there's no questioning just how much Charlize Theron shines in the action genre. From Mad Max: Fury Road to the recent arrival of The Old Guard 2, Theron consistently delivers a kick-ass performance that drops jaws in impressive action set pieces, without ever sacrificing emotional and dramatic quality. This sentiment is on full display in her 2017 action thriller Atomic Blonde, with Theron shining once again, this time under the directorial eye of David Leitch, a man also known for co-directing John Wick. Thankfully for Theron fans, this underrated entry in her filmography will soon be available to stream on a brand-new platform. As of December 1, 2025, Atomic Blonde is officially joining the ranks of HBO Max, with viewers able to indulge in the chaotic beauty of this LGBTQ+ effort that also stars James McAvoy and John Goodman. The movie finished its 2017 theatrical run just shy of $100 million in global revenue, although it managed to more than triple its reported $30 million budget. Atomic Blonde received plenty of positive praise from critics, earning a \"certified fresh\" 79% score on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus reading, \"Atomic Blonde gets enough mileage out of its stylish action sequences -- and ever-magnetic star -- to make up for a narrative that's somewhat less hard-hitting than its protagonist.\" The movie's synopsis reads: \"Sensual and savage, Lorraine Broughton is the most elite spy in MI6, an agent who's willing to use all of her lethal skills to stay alive during an impossible mission. With the Berlin Wall about to fall, she travels into the heart of the city to retrieve a priceless dossier and take down a ruthless espionage ring. Once there, she teams up with an embedded station chief to navigate her way through the deadliest game of spies.\" Charlize Theron Is About to Star in the Biggest Action Movie of the Decade Several high-profile titles are joining the 2026 theatrical circuit, but perhaps none is more enticing than Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey. Promising to be the most ambitious effort in the great man's impressive filmography, the film boasts an extraordinary cast list led by Matt Damon in his first leading role in a Nolan film. This cast list also includes the likes of Theron, Robert Pattinson, Zendaya, Anne Hathaway, Tom Holland, Jon Bernthal, John Leguizamo, Benny Safdie, Elliot Page, and many more. Atomic Blonde will soon stream on HBO Max. Stay tuned to Collider for more streaming stories.",

            "content": "The Los Angeles Rams suffered a disappointing defeat to the Carolina Panthers in Week 13, and it came in an unfortunately fitting fashion. Matthew Stafford has played at an MVP level this season, fueling the Rams’ early-season run out to a 9-2 start. However, he was the source of 3 turnovers in Week 13. The Panthers, meanwhile, were unapologetic in victory, making their feelings about Stafford and the Rams painfully clear. Panthers CB Mike Jackson Takes Shot at Matthew Stafford Stafford completed 18 of 28 passes (64. 3%) for 243 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions, 2 sacks taken, and 1 game-sealing fumble lost. One of his interceptions went for a Panthers touchdown. It was Panthers cornerback Mike Jackson who did the damage on the play. “We just came to play today,” Jackson told reporters postgame. “All week, ya’ll [the media] just kept talking about how great he is, and how he’s Superman with no cape. And it was just like, at the end of the day, it’s like who’s better today? And we were. We got the ball out twice shoot! Three times. So, we got the result that we wanted.” Stafford had not thrown an interception since Week 3, when the Rams lost on the road 33-26 to the Philadelphia Eagles. He had not thrown multiple interceptions all season. This was just his second multi-turnover game of the campaign. “Matthew Stafford has thrown 31 pick-6s in his career,” NFL senior researcher Dante Koplowitz-Fleming noted in a post on X on November 30. “1 behind Brett Favre (32) for the most in NFL history.” Panthers HC Dave Canales Drops Strong Message on Rams Panthers head coach Dave Canales, who coached against McVay and the Rams as a member of the Seattle Seahawks staff from 2010 through 2022, was confident in his team. They entered the contest as multi-touchdown underdogs. “Canales told team: We’ve seen the Rams best football. They haven’t seen ours yet,” The Athletic’s Joe Person reported on X on November 30. The Panthers got above . 500 (7-6) with the win and find themselves back in the playoff hunt. This is the first loss for Stafford and the Rams since Week 5 in overtime against the San Francisco 49ers. While that was costly in the NFC West race at the time, this loss has even greater implications for the Rams. Rams Lose No. 1 Seed to Bears Stafford and the Rams entered Week 13 as the No. 1 seed in the NFC. However, their loss shifted the balance of power in the Chicago Bears’ favor. The two teams are both 9-3, but the Bears own the top slot by virtue of their in-conference record. “With the Rams’ loss to the Panthers, the Bears will enter December as the No. 1 seed in the NFC,” The Athletic’s Dianna Russini posted on X after LA fell. A Rams loss to the Arizona Cardinals in Week 14, combined with a Bears win, would sting.",

Rodgers and the Steelers led the game 7-3 as they began the second half with the ball. The four-time NFL MVP dropped back to pass and was rocked by Bills defensive end Joey Bosa. Rodgers’ face scraped across the frozen grass as he landed on his already broken left wrist. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS. COM Bills defensive back Christian Benford scooped up the loose ball and returned it for a touchdown. Rodgers was seen bleeding from the bridge of his nose as he returned to the sideline. Mason Rudolph replaced Rodgers on the next drive. He threw an interception to Benford and it set up a Josh Allen touchdown drive.

Beauty influencer Stefanie Pieper was reportedly found dead after her body was discovered inside a suitcase in a Slovene forest, following an alleged confession from her ex-boyfriend. The 31-year-old Austrian influencer known for her makeup, fashion and singing content on social media went missing after returning home from a Christmas party last Sunday, Nov. 23, according to Styrian State Police. Pieper's ex-boyfriend allegedly admitted to strangling her, hiding her body in a suitcase and burying it in the forest. He later led authorities to her body, according to Kronen Zeitung, a major Austrian newspaper. Following the Christmas party, Pieper reportedly messaged a friend saying she had arrived home safely, but soon sent another message saying she thought someone was in her stairwell. Her neighbors also said they heard arguing and allegedly saw Pieper's ex-boyfriend in the building, People Magazine reported, citing local outlets including Oe24, 20 Minuten and Kleine Zeitung.",

The brand makes cheaper models that still have important features like self-emptying docks and these are some of the best value options on the robot vacuum market. For instance, the Q7 M5+ has 10, 000Pa of suction, two brushes that don’t tangle, LiDAR navigation and a base that empties itself and holds up to seven weeks of debris and it costs a lot less than some flagship models. The good news is that Amazon has just cut the price of this combo to $219 for Cyber Monday, down from its usual price of $359 and this is the lowest price ever. See at Amazon Easy to empty yourself without the high price tag The RockDock Plus base station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin into a sealed bag that holds about seven to nine weeks’ worth of dirt, pet hair and other debris, depending on how big your home is and how messy it is. Because of that extra space, you can basically forget about taking care of your vacuum for almost two months. Instead of emptying dustbins after every cleaning session, you can just check in every so often to change bags. The sealed bag system keeps allergens and fine dust particles from getting into the air when you empty it by hand and it makes it perfect for homes with allergies or sensitivities. When the bag is full, you can quickly lift it up and put it back down again without making dust clouds or having to touch the dirt that has built up. The 10, 000Pa HyperForce suction picks up everything from fine dust on hardwood floors to pet hair that has been stuck in carpets without needing to go over the same area more than once: That level of suction is comparable to models that cost twice as much, and it works well on all types of floors. Roborock made the dual anti-tangle system with JawScrapers’ main brush technology which stops hair from getting stuck in the roller and it also has a side brush that won’t get tangled even when cleaning up long human hair or shedding from double-coated dogs. PreciSense LiDAR navigation makes precise floor plans of your home and shows where rooms and furniture are so that you can clean them more quickly. Unlike older models, this vacuum doesn’t bump around your space at random and instead, it follows planned paths that make sure it covers everything without going over the same area more than once. You can also use the Roborock app to set no-go zones so that the vacuum doesn’t go near pet food bowls, delicate rugs, or places with cables. Virtual walls make boundaries without needing to put up physical barriers. This combination vacuum and mop can pick up both dry and sticky messes in one pass: It automatically switches between modes based on the type of floor and your preferences. With three adjustable water flow settings, you can choose how much water to use when mopping. For example, you can use light moisture on sealed hardwood or heavier flow on tile and laminate that can handle more water. The vacuum works just as well on carpets as it does on hard floors because it automatically adjusts the suction power when it detects rugs or carpets and lowers it on hard surfaces to save battery life. The edge cleaning works well because the side brush can get into corners and along baseboards where dirt builds up. The design is small enough to fit under furniture and around chair legs which lets it get to places that upright vacuums can’t. For $219, you can get the Roborock Q7 M5+ with its self-emptying dock and it is a great deal because similar systems from iRobot or Shark usually cost between $400 and $600. Here you can get a robot vacuum system that makes it easy to keep your floors clean every day.",

            "content": "BGSU women’s basketball (3-4) secured its first home win of the season at the Stroh Center against the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons (4-4), winning 56-53 on Sunday. “Fort Wayne is a really good team. They can really stretch the floor, have some perimeter shooters, while playing hard,” said head coach Fred Chmiel. “All in all, a win is a win, and it’s fantastic to be home.” The Falcons’ first quarter was electric, scoring 19 points to begin the game. Junior guard Paige Kohler and sophomore guard Johnea Donahue managed to identify open players inside the paint and beyond the three-point line for easy buckets. BG shot an efficient 50% from the floor in the opening quarter. Yet, the Orange and Brown season struggles offensively reappeared as the Mastodons quickly solved BG’s weaknesses, as they forced the Falcons to only five points in the second quarter. Bowling Green managed to shoot 14. 3% from the hardwood in the second quarter, including only making one triple out of six attempts. “In the first quarter, I thought we did a great job of moving the basketball and the ball found who needed to shoot it,” said Chmiel. “I thought in the second quarter, we were taking two dribbles too many out of our sets. We were losing those shooting windows. We didn’t get ahead of the possession, and the defense [Fort Wayne] was always catching up to our next movement, so we were easy to guard when that happened.” Even with Kohler leading the Falcons in total points scored with 15 on the afternoon, she shot 29% from the field, going 5-17. Donahue finished the game, scoring 12 points, but she was more efficient, shooting 50% from the floor. BGSU’s shot efficiency increased after halftime; however, as a team, Bowling Green’s field goal percentage was at 37. 5% after the conclusion of both the third and fourth quarters. Having said that, the Orange and Brown were 4-17 from downtown in the second half, which contributed to the lack of scoring. “We changed it up in the third quarter, got back to the first quarter movement,” said Chmiel. “And then we made some critical shots in the fourth quarter, so pretty proud of our effort, but our shooting does need to improve.” Ball movement was one of the positives following the win, which proved to be key in today’s win against Purdue Fort Wayne. Bowling Green finished the game having tallied 13 assists while the Mastodons only managed seven assists. Additionally, BG can hang their head high knowing as a team they combined for 11 second chance opportunities against Purdue Fort Wayne. “When you’re shooting 35% from the field and 20% from the three-point line, second chance points are critical,” said Chmiel. “You know, we got 11 of them off 13 rebounds, and I think we could add more.” Now, BGSU will focus its sights on its next opponent, Kentucky State, as that game will be played this upcoming Wednesday at the Stroh Center at 7: 00 p. m.",

The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has said that the president received “advanced imaging” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center “as part of his routine physical examination” and that the results showed Trump remains in “exceptional physical health.” Trump added Sunday that he has “no idea” on what part of his body he got the MRI. “It was just an MRI,” he said. “What part of the body?

            "content": "Today marks exactly one year since the Hyperliquid genesis event and the launch of its native token YPE on November 29, 2024. The project is celebrating its first anniversary just as its long-awaited weekly unlocks officially begin, a moment the community has been anticipating for months. This anniversary isn’t just symbolic. It marks the start of a new distribution era, one that will test the ecosystem’s maturity while adding clarity to how the Hyperliquid team manages supply, incentives, and trust. The first unlock is already live. And the numbers give a clear picture of how Hyperliquid intends to move forward. A Look Back at Genesis: The Day Hyperliquid Broke the Mold The Hyperliquid genesis event made waves across the entire crypto landscape last year. It launched with a massive airdrop of 310 million YPE tokens to almost 94, 000 early users, immediately setting the tone for a different kind of ecosystem. No private rounds. No VC allocations. No institutional lockups shaping the early supply. Instead, Hyperliquid chose a VC-free launch, a bold stance that placed ownership directly in the hands of traders, market makers, and early builders. At a time when most new chains and protocols were leaning heavily on venture money, Hyperliquid went in the opposite direction, and the market took notice. That ethos made the project one of the standout stories of late 2024. And now, one year later, the first major supply unlock since staking began is finally here. Weekly Unlocks Begin: 2. 6 Million YPE Unstaked After months of anticipation, Hyperliquid’s Weekly Unlocks officially started today. The first batch: 2. 6 million YPE tokens unstaked. But what happened next is what caught the community’s attention. Hyperliquid did not simply dump these tokens into the market. Instead, the movements were precise, controlled, and, for many holders, surprisingly bullish. Breakdown of the First Unlock: 2. 6M YPE unstaked in total 854k YPE immediately restaked by the Hyperlabs team 1. 745M YPE distributed to team wallets This distribution triggered deeper tracking of how these tokens were managed once they arrived in team-controlled wallets. And the follow-through tells its own story. Where Did the Tokens Go? A Transparent, Trackable Breakdown From the 1. 745 million tokens sent to team wallets, the internal allocation followed three clear paths: 1. 609k YPE Sold OTC These tokens were sold over-the-counter through Flowdesk. This is the key detail that has many community members feeling more optimistic than expected. The sale did not go through open market sell pressure. No slippage. No spot-market impact. No sudden price walls. OTC is typically used by teams that want: controlled liquidity distribution, reduced volatility, and long-term holders rather than short-term traders. 2. 235k YPE Restaked Team members voluntarily restaked a meaningful share of their tokens. This signals: internal confidence, long-term alignment, and commitment to maintaining validator security. 3. 902k YPE Remaining in Spot on Hypercore This portion is currently untouched. No sells. No staking movements. No transfers. It sits idle, likely awaiting either future internal allocations or transparent movement updates. Community Reaction: Controlled Unlocks Seen as a Positive Signal The response from traders and long-time HYPE holders has been cautiously optimistic, even bullish. The key reason: the team chose OTC sales instead of market sells. That single decision prevented sudden price swings and reduced the risk of cascading volatility. For a token that prides itself on fair launch principles, this approach reinforces the culture of sustainability over short-term extraction. A researcher tracking the wallets publicly wrote: “Seems quite bullish to me. The team is only selling OTC, not on the market. Will keep tracking what they are doing.” Transparency and clean on-chain behavior matter, especially in ecosystems built around high-frequency traders and large liquidity flows. Hyperliquid’s consistency in showing its work strengthens that trust. Why This Unlock Matters: A New Phase for Hyperliquid The first anniversary also marks the official beginning of Hyperliquid’s next phase. The market is watching closely for several reasons: 1. Supply Dynamics Are Changing For the first time, meaningful unlocks introduce new liquid tokens into circulation. How these are handled will shape price behavior, market depth, and staking incentives. 2. The Team’s Behavior Sets the Tone If the team continues using OTC channels and restaking their allocations, it may reduce volatility and reinforce long-term alignment. 3. Growth Expectations Are Rising Hyperliquid is no longer a new experiment. It is now: a year old, deeply integrated across on-chain trading, and supported by one of the most active derivatives ecosystems in crypto. The market wants to see how weekly unlocks affect metrics like: open interest, daily volume, staker participation, and governance flows. So far, week one has delivered a cleaner outcome than many expected. A Full Year Later: Hyperliquid’s Identity Remains Intact One year after its VC-free genesis, Hyperliquid is still operating with the same principles it started with: transparency, community ownership, and open market behavior that doesn’t blindside holders. The launch of weekly unlocks could have introduced chaos. Instead, it has shown a methodical, predictable approach that maintains confidence and supports long-term sustainability. Hyperliquid enters year two with: a growing user base, a maturing token economy, and a clear structure for unlocks and supply movements. The ecosystem now faces its next test: converting this careful management into continued growth and product expansion. For now, the first unlock has landed cleanly. And the market is watching what Hyperliquid does next. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.",

            "content": "O homem que morreu após invadir o recinto de uma leoa no Parque Arruda Câmara, conhecido como Bica, em João Pessoa, na Paraíba, foi identificado como Gerson de Melo Machado, de 19 anos. Gerson morreu na tarde deste domingo (30/11). Ele era conhecido, também, pelo apelido de “Vaqueirinho”. Segundo informações preliminares, ele sofria de transtornos mentais e entrou de forma irregular na área restrita do animal, e acabou sendo fatalmente atacado. Imagens que circulam nas redes sociais registram o momento da invasão. No vídeo, é possível observar o homem escalando uma estrutura lateral da jaula. Em seguida, Gerson utiliza o tronco de uma árvore localizada dentro do recinto como apoio para, finalmente, entrar no espaço onde a leoa estava. Logo após invadir o local, ele é atacado pelo animal. Nota da prefeitura Em nota oficial, a Prefeitura de João Pessoa informou que o homem “escalou rapidamente uma parede de mais de 6 metros, passou pelas grades de segurança, usou uma árvore como apoio e entrou no recinto da leoa”. A administração municipal declarou que já iniciou a apuração das circunstâncias do caso, manifestou solidariedade à família da vítima e reafirmou que o zoológico segue todas as normas técnicas e de segurança. A Polícia Militar e o Instituto de Polícia Científica da Paraíba (IPC) foram acionados para realizar os procedimentos cabíveis. O zoológico foi imediatamente fechado após o ataque, e as visitas foram suspensas. Ainda não há previsão para a reabertura. No momento da invasão, o parque estava aberto ao público e recebia visitantes, o que gerou pânico entre as pessoas que presenciaram a cena. Equipes de segurança e socorro atuaram rapidamente, mas o homem não resistiu aos ferimentos provocados pelo ataque da leoa.",

            "content": "Wide receiver Keon Coleman is back in the Bills’ lineup on Sunday and he extended their lead over the Steelers in the third quarter. Coleman caught a one-yard touchdown from quarterback Josh Allen to move the Steelers’ lead to 16-3 with 8: 49 to play in the third. Kicker Matt Prater missed the extra point, so that remains the score in Pittsburgh. Prater kicked the extra point from the usual spot, but, for the second time in this game, there was a personal foul on a touchdown. Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward was flagged this time, which should have given the Bills a chance to go for two from the 1-yard line, but the penalty was enforced on the kickoff despite the NFL rulebook saying that “on a touchdown, the penalty, whether a live ball or dead ball foul or a foul between downs, is enforced on the Try.” The Steelers also had a personal foul on their touchdown in the first half and tried an extra point from the traditional spot. CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore said at the time that the penalty should have been enforced before the try, but came back in the second half with an explanation for why it wasn’t. “We were right in the bridge from when a play ends and when the point after try occurs when DK Metcalf made the gesture that he made,” Steratore said. “They had already gotten the football ready to start for the point after try, that does allow Buffalo the option to take it on the kickoff or on the PAT.” The flag on wide receiver DK Metcalf came while Jaylen Warren was celebrating his touchdown and the Heyward flag came immediately after Coleman scored. Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers returned after missing a series in the wake of a sack by Bills defensive end Joey Bosa. The Steelers punted quickly, however, and the Bills are firmly in control of this one.",

            "content": "\"Yeah, so we’re not gonna do a season recap. I’m just finished with the game here.\" Bill Belichick’s first year as head coach of the UNC football team came to a close on Saturday, with the Tar Heels capping off a disappointing 4-8 season with a 42-19 loss to regional rival NC State. And in the immediate aftermath of that season-ending loss, the former Patriots head coach wasn’t exactly in the mood to reflect on a season gone awry. In a vintage press conference all too familiar to his days in front of a mic in Foxborough, Belichick largely grumbled through a four-minute meeting with the media. “We’ll take a look at the season later,” Belichick said when asked what factors made his first year coaching in the collegiate ranks a challenge. “Just finished with the game ten minutes ago, so.” The six-time Super Bowl champion head coach also brushed aside a question about what lessons he learned from his opening campaign at Chapel Hill. “Yeah, we just got done with the game, OK?” Belichick said. “So . yeah, so we’re not gonna do a season recap. I’m just finished with the game here. We’ll do a season recap when we get done, you know, alright? I mean, sorry.” Belichick’s approach in his final postgame presser of the year drew plenty of criticism from Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio on Sunday. “The dismissive attitude works when a coach is winning,” Florio wrote. “When a coach is struggling, it has a much different feel. As I’ve said time and again about Belichick, if he wants to avoid answering fair and reasonable questions from reporters on a regular basis, he should go coach high-school lacrosse and be compensated accordingly. “He works for a public institution now. He makes $10 million per year from that university. He’s the primary face and voice of the football program. Short, chippy, and argumentative answers become an even worse look when he’s working for a school that is funded by the people and that ultimately belongs to them.” Despite the Hall-of-Fame resume that Belichick achieved in the NFL, that same success hasn’t translated to the collegiate ranks. Beyond the headlines and distractions regarding Belichick’s continued grudge against the Patriots and his relationship with Jordon Hudson, a Belichick-coached UNC team seriously underperformed on the gridiron. The Tar Heels had plenty of momentum entering Belichick’s first year as head coach, with UNC football general manager Mike Lombardi deeming the program as the “33rd team” in the NFL. But after opening the year with ESPN’s “College GameDay” in town for a primetime matchup against TCU (a 48-14 loss), the Tar Heels were largely uncompetitive with their four wins coming against Charlotte, Richmond, Syracuse, and Stanford. In total, UNC lost five games by 15 or more points in 2025, and failed to punch its ticket to a Bowl Game for the first time since 2018. Reports sprouted up in October that Belichick was discussing “buyout options” with UNC prompting both Belichick and the school to reaffirm their commitment to one another in a brief social-media statement.",

This comes as Los Blancos are now one point behind leaders Barcelona, having failed to win their last three league games. Real Madrid dictated proceedings at the start of the encounter against Girona, and Kylian Mbappe thought he had broken the deadlock in the 40th minute. However, his goal was ruled out by the video assistant referee for a handball in the build-up. Thanks for the submission! Five minutes later (45’), Azzedine Ounahi rifled his strike into the back of the net to put the hosts ahead. Vinicius Junior won his side a much-needed opportunity to make the scoreline even after Hugo Rincon fouled him in the penalty box in the 65th minute. Two minutes later (67'), Mbappe dispatched the penalty into the back of the net to bring Real Madrid on level terms. After scoring from the spot, the visitors strived but failed to score the goal that might have guaranteed all three points. Thus, the encounter ended 1-1 as both teams shared the spoils. Notably, Los Blancos won nine out of their opening ten games of the 2025-26 LaLiga term. However, they were held to two consecutive draws against Rayo Vallecano and Elche, leading to the game against Girona. After they also dropped points against Blanquivermells, disappointed Real Madrid supporters took to X to vent their frustration with the manager. One fan tweeted: \"XABI OUT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.\" Other users reacted: \"Season is still long\" Xabi Alonso says as Real Madrid fail to win their third consecutive LaLiga encounter Los Blancos manager Xabi Alonso has suggested that the 2025-26 LaLiga campaign is far from being completed. He went on to claim that the structure of the league table will change several times. The table will change many times. We have the opportunity to get 3 points next game.\" Los Blancos have registered 33 points from 14 league games this season and are one point behind leaders Barcelona (34) in the title race. Alonso's men will travel to Bilbao to take on Athletic Bilbao in their next league game on Wednesday, December 3.",

            "content": "Sunday night marks the end of the 30-day extension for negotiations involving the new WNBA CBA. However, the league and the players' union have yet to announce the finalization of a new CBA, with revenue sharing and salary increase being two sticking points in the negotiations. It's possible that both parties could agree to another extension if CBA talks continue to stall. However, there are major consequences that could unfold if the WNBA and WNBPA still can't get on the same page. WNBA CBA extension deadline: 3 major consequences if no deal is reached over salary increase Major events on the WNBA's calendar could get delayed As reported by Madeline Kenney of The New York Post, certain events on the WNBA's calendar will be put on hold until a new WNBA CBA is agreed upon. These events include expansion drafts for the incoming teams Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, free agency, and annual WNBA draft. Though the WNBA draft for players coming out of college is typically scheduled in April, a delay in the schedule for either expansion draft would compromise the preparations of the Tempo and Fire organizations. Also, the rosters of all WNBA teams would be up in the air as well if the free agency period gets pushed back. The WNBA gets bad PR while other leagues can look good The longer the wait for a new WNBA CBA, the bigger the PR hit that the WNBA will take. With other players' associations expressing their solidarity with the WNBPA, the WNBA is under a lot of pressure to reach an agreement with its players. If the WNBA fails to do this, other leagues like Unrivaled and the so-called \"Project B\" can step in and project themselves as organizations that take better care of the athletes. During the inaugural season of Unrivaled earlier this year, the significantly better salaries and benefits that its players received were cast in the spotlight. These perks will be underscored even more if the WNBA CBA remains in limbo. The league and its players will move one step closer to work stoppage On the one hand, it doesn't appear likely at this point that the WNBA will lock its players out, given the tremendous popularity of its biggest stars like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, and Paige Bueckers. On the other hand, the scenario of a lockout remains plausible so long as a new WNBA CBA isn't finalized. The players can also opt to go on strike if the league continues to disagree on salient issues like salary increase.",

Beginning his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Bonds went on to spend fifteen seasons with the San Francisco Giants. Ad Featuring on Sunday's episode of \"Splash Hit Territory\", fellow Giants great J. T. Snow recalled his first interaction with Bonds. \"We had the same agent, so I knew Barry off the field,\" Snow said. [27: 59] \"The first time I ever met Barry, we were at a fundraiser and he came up, we talked and he said 'you provide the defense and I'll provide the offense.' I said I could swing it too, you know, I just got done hitting like 24 (homers) and driving in 100 runs. He was like 'just worry about the defense.' Ad Trending 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now Ad Further, Snow revealed how learned a lot about hitting from Barry Bonds, so much so that it helped him extend his career by a few years. \"He was the smartest hitter I ever played with, and you got to tap into him. He didn't come out and just volunteer (for) stuff, but when you got him on a plane, or you got him in the dugout, he was great. He really added about 2, 3 years on my career, because I adjusted (my hitting approach) later in my career,\" Snow added. Ad Despite being honored by both the Pirates and the Giants, Barry Bonds failed to make it to Cooperstown Since calling time on his big league career, Barry Bonds has been honored by both franchises he represented during his career, with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants inducting him into their respective Halls of Fame. Ad For someone that boasts the kind of stats and accolades Bonds does, making it into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on the first go would usually be a foregone conclusion. However, alleged ties to performance enhancing drugs proved to be a significant deterrent for Bonds' aspirations of making it to Cooperstown. As a result, the slugger did not recieve the required 75% of the vote-share during his ten years of eligibility. Naturally, this remains quite a controversial topic amongst fans and experts alike. × Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "On November 16, 2025 at the San Antonio Fear Fest in San Antonio, Texas, EXODUS guitarist Gary Holt spoke to Robb Chavez of Robbs MetalWorks about the band's recently completed follow-up to 2021's \"Persona Non Grata\" album. He said (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH. NET): \"It's fucking awesome. It'll be out next March, I think March 20 and it's fucking awesome. I mean, it's so awesome. We're so proud of this record.\" According to Holt, EXODUS completed nearly two albums' worth of material during the latest recording sessions, with a view toward releasing the second collection of songs when the first touring cycle is finished. \"80 percent of the follow-up [to EXODUS's next album] is done already,\" Holt explained. \"We just kept working. We never stopped. We were in the studio for two months. And we tend to record by. We all live together in a house, or sometimes we build a studio in a house, and it's like heavy metal summer camp. But we like each other enough to live together still. A lot of bands that's a rarity. And so we write the whole process. When we started recording, we only had four songs done and a million ideas. And Lee [Altus, longtime EXODUS guitarist] wrote a ton of stuff; he wrote four out of 10 songs on the new album.\" Gary also talked about the return of EXODUS singer Rob Dukes, who replaced Steve \"Zetro\" Souza in January. He said: \"It's fucking been amazing. When you hear [Rob's] vocals on this new record, you're gonna shit your pants.\" Elaborating on what fans can expect from the new EXODUS material, Holt said: \"The new album is so killer, dude. And everybody says that I know that but, dude, this album's so good. Me and [EXODUS drummer] Tom Hunting call each other and [I tell him], when I listen to it, it makes me wanna cry, it's so good. It's that fucking good. We made something special.\" Asked what it is about the new EXODUS album that is so good, Gary explained: \"It's just the songs, dude. It's all about the songs. I mean, it's crushing, but it's all anthems. And it's so varied, this record. So many different aspects of EXODUS are in there, from the blinding speed to the slowest, heaviest shit we've ever done. And Rob's vocals are, like, at the top of the pyramid on this shit.\" As for the status of the second collection of new songs EXODUS had written during the most recent sessions, Gary said: \"We still gotta record a little bit more to complete it. Our goal, we fell a little bit short. We have eight songs done. It was hard picking which ones go on this, 'cause I still, to this day, I have panic attacks, like, 'I should have put that one on it. That song is so sick.' But you're trying to balance a record. And we just picked what we thought were the best ones for this album.\" At last month's Aftershock festival in Sacramento, California, Holt told Baby Huey and Chasta of the San Francisco radio station 107. It's crushing, but it's also all anthems. Every song's an anthem. It's awesome. We're super proud of this record.\" Lewis had previously worked with MEGADETH, WHITECHAPEL, DEVILDRIVER and BAD WOLVES, among many others. The follow-up to \"Persona Non Grata\" will mark the first time in nearly three decades that an EXODUS album hasn't been mixed by Andy Sneap, who has acted as JUDAS PRIEST's producer and touring guitarist for more than seven years. Gary previously wrote on Instagram about EXODUS's collaboration with Lewis: \"First album since 97 to mix with someone else, and it's crushing. Andy said it's time to venture out of our comfort zone and it's amazing. Mark has CRUSHED IT!\" In a recent interview with Chicago's Rebel Radio 92. 5 FM as part of the station's 31st-anniversary celebration, Dukes praised the material on EXODUS's upcoming effort, saying: \"It's killer. It's the best thing I've ever done with EXODUS. I thought [2010's] 'Exhibit B: [The Human Condition]' was probably some of my best work, and I think this tops it. It's so different than what we've done. We've added so many little different things that it's still EXODUS, but we've definitely stepped outside the box a little bit and tried a few different things and it worked well. It's fast. it's dark, it's awesome, man. It's gonna be a lot of fun to go play these songs live.\" Souza joined EXODUS in 1986 after previously fronting the band LEGACY (which later became TESTAMENT). He remained in the band until their hiatus in 1993, but rejoined them for two years from 2002 to 2004. Dukes had joined EXODUS in 2005 (following Souza's departure) and remained until 2014, when Souza rejoined. Dukes previously joined EXODUS in January 2005 and appeared on four of the band's studio albums \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\" (2005),\"The Atrocity Exhibition. Exhibit A\" (2007),\"Let There Be Blood\" (2008, a re-recording of EXODUS's classic 1985 LP, \"Bonded By Blood\") and \"Exhibit B: The Human Condition\" (2010). EXODUS played its first concert with Dukes in nearly 11 years on April 5 at the Decibel Magazine Metal & Beer Fest: Philly at the Fillmore in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",

Rodgers fumbled and the ball was scooped up by Bills cornerback Christian Benford, who raced 17 yards for a go-ahead touchdown. Rodgers laid face-down on the turf at Acrisure Stadium before getting up and jogging to the sideline. He shook his right hand before going into the medical tent to be evaluated. Rodgers was replaced by backup Mason Rudolph, who threw an interception shortly after entering. ___ AP NFL:.",

            "content": "Courtroom dramas are a great vehicle for storytelling. They provide a compact forum for contrasting narratives, inherent conflict through the prosecution and defense, and a natural space for powerful monologues. The justice system is a crucial part of our lives, and the best movies in this often-misunderstood genre place it under the microscope. With this in mind, this list ranks the finest courtroom dramas of the last century. The titles below range from biopics and thrillers to historical documents and moral statements. A few are universal in their implications, transcending their time and place. However, they all aim to open eyes and awaken minds, proving that some movie genres can truly transcend the screen. 10 ‘Marshall’ (2017) \"You cannot fight racism with silence.\" Before the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, a young Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) traveled the country defending Black citizens in racially charged trials. Here, he defends a Black chauffeur (Sterling K. Brown) accused of assaulting his white employer, only to be barred from speaking in court. Marshall is forced to strategize from the gallery, guiding a local Jewish lawyer (Josh Gad) unfamiliar with criminal defense. The film blends procedural beats with historical portraiture, showing how justice in America has often depended on individual courage (and more than a little stubbornness). Before the civil rights movement gained momentum, challenging racist institutions required serious grit and sacrifice. In this regard, Marshall is not only a courtroom story but an origin myth for a legal titan. Marshall would go on to be one of the most influential American lawyers of his day, and eventually a Supreme Court justice. 9 ‘Witness for the Prosecution’ (1957) \"The questions must be answered, Mr. Vole.\" Billy Wilder turns legal drama into a razor-wire duel of wit and deception, weaving in elements of noir and black comedy. When a charming veteran (Tyrone Power) is accused of murdering a wealthy widow, legendary barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) frail, recovering from illness, yet still formidable defies doctors’ orders to defend him. On its surface, the plot is a classic murder trial with a defendant claiming innocence and a cunning prosecutor circling like a hawk, but the brilliance lies in the layers of performance, trust, and manipulation between husband and wife witnesses. Every testimony amps up the suspense, every revelation makes us rethink what we assumed to be true. The whole way through, Wilder balances tension with character humor, making the courtroom feel both theatrical and real. It’s a masterclass in misdirection, reminding us that justice can hinge on whether we believe a story. and how easily we can believe the wrong one. 8 ‘The Verdict’ (1982) \"There is no other justice. There is only this.\" Paul Newman earned an Oscar nomination for this fantastic late-career performance. Here, he plays Frank Galvin, a disgraced, alcoholic lawyer grasping at redemption. Offered a medical malpractice case that could settle quickly and quietly, he refuses the payout and instead forces a trial, convinced the comatose patient at its center deserves the dignity denied her. What follows is a bruising fight against a powerful hospital, a stacked legal machine, and the protagonist's failing reputation. Sidney Lumet (no stranger to courtroom masterpieces) directs all this with a weary moral gravity. The aesthetics mirror the mood, all dimly lit bars, suffocating courtrooms, and snow-blown streets. Rather than being a conventional legal thriller, The Verdict becomes an emotional reckoning. When Frank rises to speak, voice trembling, you feel a lifetime of regret turning into something like grace. Through him, the movie makes a statement on trying again when the world has written you off. 7 ‘Anatomy of a Murder’ (1959) \"Facts are stubborn things.\" This groundbreaking drama revolves around small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (James Stewart), who defends an army lieutenant (Ben Gazzara) accused of killing a man who allegedly assaulted his wife (Lee Remick). It was provocative material for mainstream Hollywood movies in the 1950s. Rather than sensationalizing it, Anatomy of a Murder leans into ambiguity: motives blur, testimony contradicts, and it's not just the facts but morality itself that's up for question. In the courtroom, charm, instinct, and performance carry as much weight as truth. The film embraces this idea to the full, refusing to hand the audience a clean verdict. We never truly know where justice lies or who deserves sympathy. In the process, it asks tough questions about the possibility of true justice in a system run by fallible humans. With bold dialogue that shocked 1950s audiences and jazz inflections underscoring its cool detachment, Anatomy of a Murder laid the template for modern legal drama. 6 ‘Judgment at Nuremberg’ (1961) \"A country isn’t a rock. It’s people.\" An important work of historical witness. This monumental film from liberal icon Stanley Kramer reconstructs the post-World War II trial where American judges prosecuted German officials complicit in Nazi atrocities. Rather than focusing on generals, it targets seemingly respectable jurists, men who didn’t kill, but legitimized killing through law. Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) listens as witnesses recount sterilization, torture, and state-sanctioned cruelty, while defense attorneys argue that obedience and patriotism absolve them of responsibility. In the process, Judgment at Nuremberg confronts banal, bureaucratic evil. The film forces viewers to ask whether morality can defer to authority and whether a legal system can remain neutral in the face of inhumanity. The events it depicts were hugely influential, reshaping how the modern world would think about national sovereignty, individual responsibility, and the possibility of universal moral principles. 5 ‘Erin Brockovich’ (2000) \"They’re poisoning people, and they know it.\" Julia Roberts shines in this true-story drama about a single mother who stumbles into a massive corporate cover-up of contaminated drinking water. Working at a small law firm, Erin pushes past condescension, class bias, and her own lack of formal training to build a case for families sickened by pollution. The star won the Oscar for her efforts. The plot moves from dusty archives to kitchen-table interviews to the courtroom, striking a pitch-perfect balance between depth and entertainment value. Erin Brockovich isn’t a story about legal procedure so much as the cost of ignoring ordinary people’s voices, and Steven Soderbergh tells it with utmost style and energy. The director was on a ridiculous roll at the time, cranking Erin Brockovich out of The Limey and then following it up with the one-two punch of Traffic and Ocean's Eleven. 4 ‘A Few Good Men’ (1992) \"You can’t handle the truth!\" Speaking of directors on winning streaks, Rob Reiner crafted this classic as the capstone to a phenomenal run of movies: Stand By Me, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally., and Misery. When two Marines are charged with the death of a fellow soldier, Naval lawyer Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) initially views the case as routine, only to uncover layers of secrecy and divided loyalty. Opposite him stands Colonel Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson), a man who embodies authoritarian conviction. The plot escalates toward one of the most famous confrontations in movie history, where ideals of duty and morality clash. Nicholson's monologue has since become iconic, but the whole movie is solid and well-made. Fundamentally, A Few Good Men understands that the courtroom is theater and battlefield at once, and that the truth sometimes erupts only when pushed to breaking point. A smart movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. 3 ‘Anatomy of a Fall’ (2023) \"Truth isn’t the same as the story you tell.\" Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or winner blends legal thriller with psychological portrait. When a husband (Swann Arlaud) dies after falling from a snowy Alpine chalet, suspicion falls on his wife, Sandra (Sandra Hüller), a writer whose marriage was strained by creative jealousy, caregiving burdens, and emotional fatigue. Their young son (Milo Machado-Graner), visually impaired, becomes a key witness. Anatomy of a Fall unfolds through testimony, flashbacks, and subtle contradictions, turning the courtroom into a lens through which love, resentment, and artistic ego blur. What’s on trial isn’t simply a death but an entire marriage. We search for certainty in glances, pauses, and fragments, only to find that truth in relationships rarely arrives cleanly. The writing and performances are phenomenal, elevating this way beyond your typical courtroom drama. The result is one of the most perceptive and emotionally resonant movies of the 2020s, jam-packed with food for thought. 2 ‘12 Angry Men’ (1957) \"It's possible.\" 12 Angry Men never leaves the jury room, yet it unfolds like a full-on war movie: prejudice versus reason, ego versus principle, anger versus empathy. A murder trial ends in deliberation, and twelve jurors enter a sweltering room to decide a young defendant’s fate. What begins as a near-unanimous guilty vote slowly shifts as one juror (Henry Fonda) insists on scrutinizing all assumptions and evidence. As tempers flare and biases surface, each character reveals how personal baggage shapes public duty. There are no procedural twists here, no surprise witnesses. Instead, the film mines tension simply out of conversation. Disagreement and persuasion become life-shaping forces. In the process, 12 Angry Men argues that democracy is fragile precisely because it relies on patience and conscience. This message feels even more urgent now, in an era where attention spans are short, everyone's in their own information bubble, and changing someone's mind feels like a Herculean undertaking. 1 ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ (1962) \"In the name of God, do your duty.\" This one feels less like a movie and more like a modern fable. Through the eyes of young Scout (Mary Badham), we watch as Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a Black man falsely accused in the Jim Crow South. Having Scout as the viewpoint character significantly adds to the narrative impact. Through this conceit, To Kill a Mockingbird moves between courtroom drama and childhood wonder, contrasting the innocence of youth with the brutality of prejudice.",

            "content": "New Birth's lead pastor, Jamal Bryant, has led the initiative to uplift Black businesses that align with shoppers' values. Almost 100 Black businesses were spotlighted by Pastor Jamal Bryant and the New Birth Baptist Church for its new entrepreneurial initaitive. The Bullseye Black Market, beginning Nov. 28, featured these businesses in an effort to boost customer awareness and support. The vendors poured into the New Birth Baptist church’s metro Atlanta facilities for a day of intentional shopping within the community. Starting on Black Friday, widely recognized as the biggest shopping event of the year, the Bullseye Black Market aimed to pour money back into local Black-owned shops across the city. Instead of shoppers putting their dollars into big chains like Amazon or Target, they could patronize businesses that sell quality goods, keeping these entrepreneurs thriving. “It allowed me to reinvest more money into my business and help college students, one of my own, which is my daughter. So, the money, when you support my business, it helps support me and my family to be able to provide a living for us as well,” shared vendor Renee Alexander of Mrs. Renee’s Health Solutions, to 11Alive. According to New Birth’s website, the event featured holiday cheer alongside its focus on keeping Black dollars within the community. Children could also take pictures with a Black Santa Claus as families engaged in Christmas shopping for a greater purpose. Initiated by Pastor Jamal Bryant, who also spearheaded the boycotts of Target over the company’s DEI cutbacks, the first iteration of the market took place around Juneteenth. The move provided alternative places for people to shop that uplifted Black people in business, a mission many vendors still feel today. “I think it’s important for us to come out and support the community and actually educate ourselves on what products we have in the Black community because how can you buy Black if you don’t know what Black has to offer,” added vendor Gerald Dean of Been to the Bayou. The move to continuously “buy Black,” especially during the holiday season, helps shoppers support businesses that align with their values. While chains like Target have pushed back on the narrative that they don’t support diverse businesses, Bryant has remained adamant on highlighting Black entrepreneurs across the Atlanta community. The shop will remain open throughout the holiday weekend, including Sunday hours as well.",

            "content": "Travelers at the end of the Thanksgiving holiday on Sunday were finding hundreds of flights delayed and canceled in Chicago following a winter storm in the Great Lakes region, while a wintry mix of rain and snow developed in the Northeast. In Wisconsin, utility crews worked to restore power to thousands of people, while the airport in Des Moines, Iowa, reopened on the critical travel day after a Delta Connection flight landing from Detroit slid off an icy runway. No injuries were reported, and passengers were transported to the terminal by bus. Hundreds of churches in western Michigan told worshippers to stay home or watch services online. Up to 12 inches (about 30 centimeters) of snow had fallen since Saturday in areas close to Lake Michigan. On Saturday, 8. 4 inches (21. 34 centimeters) of snow fell at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, setting a record for the highest single calendar day snowfall in November at the airport, according to the National Weather Service. That broke the previous record of 8 inches (20. 32 centimeters) on Nov. 6, 1951. Over 270 flights into and out of O’Hare had been canceled by midafternoon, while over 1, 200 had been delayed, according to the tracking site FlightAware. Planes were being de-iced at several airports across the country on Sunday, including at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, according to the FAA. On Sunday afternoon there were nearly 400 flights into and out of Detroit Metro Airport that were delayed and over 300 canceled, according to FlightAware. In Wisconsin, We Energies reported more than 6, 000 power outages, with more than half in Milwaukee and South Milwaukee. Mark Paladino said on Facebook that he was shoveling snow Sunday when his apartment complex lost power in Fredonia. Others said power lines were sagging under heavy, wet snow. Elsewhere in Iowa, gusty winds Sunday were blowing snow back onto roads, extending hazardous travel conditions, the National Weather Service said. “We did have areas of Iowa and Illinois that saw over one foot of snow,” including 15 inches (38 centimeters) in Fort Dodge, Iowa, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison. He said snow in the Great Lakes region was tapering off, but a new storm was heading to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) of snow by Tuesday. “It’s going to be the first snowfall of the season for many of these areas, and it’s going to be rather significant,” Orrison said. “The good news is that it does not look like the major cities at this point are going to be looking at any significant snowfall.”.",

            "content": "Bryce Young had plenty of critics after his first two seasons. He has quieted them this season. The Panthers quarterback did it again, leading his fifth comeback of the season. In the 31-28 win over the Rams, Young threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Tetairoa McMillan on fourth-and-2 for the game-winner with 6: 34 left. “I just trust my guys. There’s no big conversation. No big hoo-rah. I mean, it’s not a big speech. I know this guy’s always ready.” It was the 11th game-winning drive in Young’s career, the most of any quarterback in the NFL since he entered in 2023. At 24 years and 164 days old, he passed Josh Allen as the youngest quarterback in NFL history with 11 game-winning drives. “Well, you don’t just become the Heisman Trophy winner and No. 1 overall pick for no reason,” Panthers center Austin Corbett said. “There’s a deep, unbelievable talent in him and his ability. And you’ll never suspect it because he’s so calm and just that true SoCal kid. Yeah, we’re just chilling like it’s another day in the office. “But just his fight, his ability just to lock in and just, just to be a dog is incredible. And the calm demeanor he has in the huddle, and just to see the passion come out in those times of success, I love playing with him. It’s amazing.” Young had the second-highest passer rating in a single game in franchise history at 147. 1, trailing only a 153. 3 by Cam Newton in 2015. He also now has a career-high 18 touchdown passes, the most by a Panthers quarterback since Newton’s 24 in 2018. The Panthers improved to 7-6 and are playoff contenders, a half-game behind the Buccaneers in the NFC South.",

            "content": "Tercer empate consecutivo fuera de casa en LaLiga. El 1-1 ante el Girona es el tercer clavo en el ataúd de Xabi Alonso como entrenador del Real Madrid, tras las igualadas ante Rayo y Elche. Tres rivales, ya lo leen ustedes, de postín. \"En esos campos se ganan las Ligas\", dice la sabiduría futbolística popular. Pues el club blanco lleva camino, tras dilapidar cinco puntos de ventaja en el liderato liguero, de haberlas perdido en Vallecas, Martínez Valero y Montilivi. Ahora llega San Mamés y, visto lo visto y escuchado lo escuchado, habrá que ver si el tolosarra llega a Navidad paseándose por el cementerio o ya le habrán oficiado un responso. El problema es que esta plantilla acusa una brutal falta de liderazgo. No en el campo, donde a Mbappé se le van cayendo los goles (¿dónde estaría el Real Madrid sin los goles del francés? Da miedo imaginarlo), sino fuera de él. Con el entrenador tiritando y la afición defraudada, nadie sale a dar una voz. Ni un solo jugador de la plantilla da la cara para decir \"nos ha vuelto a perjudicar el árbitroestamos jugando mal pero somos capaces de enderezarlo\" o el mensaje que crea conveniente, cierto o falso. Nada. Cero. Una jaula de grillos de donde sólo sale un ensordecedor ruido: una buena parte de los pesos pesados del equipo no cree en este entrenador y hay jugadores con actitudes poco profesionales. Es una evidencia abrumadora. El Madrid no es solo que no juegue a nada, o que muchos consideremos que la calidad de su plantilla no es ni por asomo la que nos han intentado hacer creer. Es que los propios futbolistas no se creen a lo que tienen que jugar. El equipo se rompe, solo ataca a base de arreones (individuales o el habitual toque de corneta final) y defiende peor que la fiscalía a García Ortiz. Como además, y es una evidencia, decide escatimar esfuerzos defensivos, el resultado es el que es: crisis. Podría ponerme aquí a recitar nombres de jugadores sobrepasados o en un estado de forma lamentable, y de otros a los que echamos de menos. Seguro que en alguno concidiríamos y en otros no, todos tenemos nuestra pedrada particular. Pero eso es lo de menos. La realidad es que no hay carácter, no hay orgullo, no hay espíritu de equipo. Y en vez de apretar los puños y hacer propósito de enmienda, deciden ni siquiera pasar por zona mixta para tranquilizar al aficionado madridista. Falta liderazgo por palets.",

Ever since, it slowly clawed back to $0. 04426. That value still marks a nearly 45. 6% drop from the 24-hour high of $0. 08141. What happened in the minutes before the plunge remains unclear. The team behind Sahara AI has remained silent. No statements, no explanations, no commentary. The silence speaks as loudly as a tweet: the project seems unprepared for this collapse. SAHARA’s streak hasn’t always looked so bleak. Not long ago, the token soared, rising from a modest $0. 02 up to $0. 16 after a major exchange listing. That surge sparked excitement. Many treated it as a sign that Sahara AI might be onto something. The hype was real, the gains were real. But hype doesn’t last. The dramatic climb didn’t hold. The price bled slowly, then sharply. Recently, SAHARA hovered around $0. 07-$0. 08. That zone looked shaky, a plateau built on expectation rather than substance. And then the bottom dropped out. Big Backing, Bigger Expectations Behind much of the early buzz stood serious money. Sahara AI raised about $49 million from well-known backers such as Pantera Capital, Polychain, and YZi Labs. That kind of financial muscle gave SAHARA legitimacy. Many thought it would carry the token through volatility. Yet cash alone doesn’t guarantee stability. The backers’ confidence might have encouraged others to jump in. But confidence needs reinforcement, and a quick drop like this erodes it fast. What the Crash Signals SAHARA’s descent isn’t just a price event. It reflects broader concerns. Several themes stand out: Falling confidence, Once investors saw sharp gains, they piled in. Now, many appear eager to exit. The speed of the fall suggests panic more than strategic profit-taking. Fragile faith in AI tokens, Sahara AI is part of a growing pack of AI-themed cryptos. The crash shows just how fragile faith in these projects can be. When the market wavers, AI branding offers no shield. No safety nets, No public response, no reassurances, no transparency. That absence unsettles remaining holders and potential investors. In short: SAHARA’s crystal-clear decline shows the danger of assuming that big money or flashy names equal long-term stability. A Risky Landscape, What New Investors Should Know For newcomers looking at altcoins, especially ones tied to trending sectors like AI, SAHARA’s crash delivers a stark lesson. These tokens can pump hard. And fast. Early adopters might cash out early and escape with gains. Or not. But the other side is uncomfortably close: a violent crash, deep losses, and little recourse. Here are key takeaways: Volatility is more the rule than the exception. A token can swing from $0. 02 to $0. 16, and back down half from there, in weeks or even days. Backing doesn’t guarantee success. Big investments may signal confidence, but they don’t guarantee sustained price support. Silence can be dangerous. Without active communication, rumors, fear, and panic can drive a collapse faster than fundamentals justify. What’s Next for Sahara AI? Right now, Sahara AI faces a crossroads. The market has reset expectations. Investors will likely wait for signals. They’ll watch for: public communication or explanation from the team, any tokenomics adjustments or new developments, renewed activity that rebuilds confidence. If none arrive, SAHARA may linger in a weak state, stuck between lukewarm support and further decline. But if Sahara AI manages to deliver a convincing roadmap or a meaningful update, some optimism may return. It won’t erase the damage. But it could stabilize the token. For now, though, SAHARA sits in a rough spot. Sahara AI’s journey, from $0. 02 to $0. 16, then crashing through $0. 03, shows how thin the line can be between boom and bust in the crypto world. Enthusiasm, good funding, and flashy listings can work wonders. They can boost a token price into the sky. But when markets shift, sentiment can turn. Fast. Maybe Sahara AI recovers. Maybe it stabilizes. Or maybe it becomes one more warning sign: treat AI-themed altcoins as high-risk, high-reward plays. For those watching, or entering, the space now: tread carefully. Don’t let momentum blinker your judgment. Ask questions. Demand transparency. Know what you’re getting into. Because in this world, what goes up can crash down, just as quickly.

            "content": "The New York Jets beat the Atlanta Falcons 27-24 with a last-second field goal. Following the team’s victory, head coach Aaron Glenn had a fiery response to the haters of the green and white. “Man, it was good to see it go in. For those guys to gut this win out and to get this win. It’s more to me than just the win that I’m looking at. I look at these guys [who] never quit, and they get bashed. Everybody on this team gets bashed for everything, and it’s okay because we know exactly what we are trying to do. We are going to continue to block out all the noise and keep our focus straight ahead and our vision of what we got and what we are trying to build as a team,” Coach Glenn explained on Sunday, November 30. The Jets Are Clearly Building Something Here With HC Aaron Glenn NFL Insider Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated posted, “Jets have now won three of their last five games after an 0-7 start, and hung in there against the Patriots and Ravens in the losses. Aaron Glenn’s program [is] starting to make some headway.” It appears the team is buying what Coach Glenn is saying. In Week 13, the Jets got help from a lot of different areas to pull off the upset win over the Falcons. One of the straws that has stirred the drink for the Jets this year is running back Breece Hall. The game plan has often been built around him. However, there was a unique twist to this week’s plan. Hall explained to Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic that he felt like a “decoy” on the offense today. “I knew we were going to air it out today because they were hanging their hat on stopping the run game. So I was playing decoy, watching everybody else. Hall finished the game with 19 rushing attempts for 68 rushing yards. He averaged 3. 6 rushing yards per carry and scored one touchdown on the ground. Through the air, the former Iowa State product caught two receptions for eight receiving yards. The Defense Still Has Major Flaws Gang Green’s defense did its best impression of Swiss cheese against the Falcons. Superstar running back Bijan Robinson ran wild all day long. He toted the rock 23 times for 142 rushing yards. He averaged 6. 2 rushing yards per carry and scored a touchdown on the ground. In the passing game, Robinson added five receptions for 51 receiving yards. Robinson averaged 10. 2 yards per catch. Despite those video game numbers, the Jets deployed a bend but don’t break defense. They did just enough in the right situations to hold on for dear life to secure their third victory of the season. The Jets won the battle, but the war is still to be determined. Is Steve Wilks the right guy to be the defensive coordinator in 2026? That question remains at large for the Jets heading into Week 14 and beyond.",

            "content": "US-Präsident Trump gibt seinem Amtsvorgänger die Schuld an dem Anschlag auf zwei Nationalgardisten in Washington. Biden habe die afghanischen Ortskräfte nicht genug überprüft. Ermittler gehen davon aus, dass der Schütze nach der Einreise zur Tat angestiftet wurde. Der nach den Schüssen auf US-Nationalgardisten in Washington festgenommene Afghane hat sich nach Angaben von Heimatschutzministerin Kristi Noem wahrscheinlich erst nach seiner Einreise in die USA radikalisiert. \"Wir gehen davon aus, dass er sich radikalisiert hat, seit er hier im Land ist\", sagte Noem im Fernsehsender NBC. Im Sender ABC ergänzte sie: \"Wir glauben, dass es durch Verbindungen in seiner Heimatgemeinde und seinem Heimatstaat geschah.\" Die US-Ermittler befragten nun alle, \"die mit ihm in Kontakt standen\", etwa Mitglieder seiner Familie. Der Täter hatte am Mittwoch auf Mitglieder der Nationalgarde im Zentrum der US-Hauptstadt geschossen. Eine 20-jährige Frau starb kurz nach dem Angriff, ein Mann wurde schwer verletzt. Der mutmaßliche Angreifer, der 29-jährige Afghane Rahmanullah L., wurde festgenommen. Sein Motiv ist bisher unklar. Er soll wegen Mordes angeklagt werden. US-Justizministerin Pam Bondi will nach eigenen Angaben die Todesstrafe für ihn fordern. Asylbescheid nach Trumps Amtsantritt Der Tatverdächtige war laut US-Medienberichten im Jahr 2021 nach dem Abzug der US-Truppen aus Afghanistan im Rahmen eines offiziellen Aufnahmeprogramms in die USA eingereist, weil er in seiner Heimat mit dem US-Auslandsgeheimdienst CIA und weiteren Regierungsstellen zusammengearbeitet hatte. Berichten zufolge beantragte er 2024 Asyl, was ihm demnach im April 2025 gewährt wurde, also bereits nach dem Amtsantritt von US-Präsident Donald Trump. Vertreter der Trump-Regierung werfen der Regierung seines Vorgängers Joe Biden nun vor, die Afghanen aus dem Aufnahmeprogramm nicht ausreichend überprüft zu haben. Noem sagte auf ABC, L. sei nach seiner Einreise in die USA \"möglicherweise überprüft\" worden, die Überprüfung sei aber \"nicht gut\" gewesen. Trump schrieb in seinem Online-Netzwerk Truth Social, Ex-Präsident Biden, der ehemalige Heimatschutzminister Alejandro Mayorkas und die ehemalige Vizepräsidentin Kamala Harris \"hätten unser Land wirklich ruiniert, indem sie alles und jeden völlig unkontrolliert und ungeprüft ins Land gelassen haben\".",

Die USA spielen dabei eine wichtige Rolle. Ihr Präsident gibt sich optimistisch. US-Präsident Donald Trump gibt sich nach Gesprächen zwischen Vertretern der Ukraine und seiner Regierung über Wege zur Beendigung des Ukraine-Kriegs optimistisch. An Bord der Präsidentenmaschine Air Force One verwies er zwar auf \"schwierige kleine Probleme\" der Ukrainer und nannte als Beispiel den \"nicht hilfreichen\" Korruptionsskandal in dem Land. Die Nachfrage einer Journalistin, ob das die Friedensgespräche behindere, bejahte er allerdings nicht und führte vielmehr kurz darauf aus: \"Ich denke, es gibt eine gute Chance, dass wir einen Deal machen können\". Einmal mehr gab sich Trump dabei auch überzeugt, dass sowohl Russland als auch die Ukraine ein Ende des Krieges wollten. Der US-Präsident bestätigte, dass sich sein Sondergesandter Steve Witkoff diese Woche mit Kremlchef Wladimir Putin in Moskau treffen soll. Ein genaues Datum für das Treffen nannte er aber nicht. Zuvor hatten Witkoff, Außenminister Marco Rubio und andere US-Regierungsvertreter an diesem Sonntag im Bundesstaat Florida eine ukrainische Delegation getroffen, um Fragen zu einem möglichen Friedensplan zu besprechen. Vor kurzem war ein erster 28-Punkte-Plan der USA für ein Kriegsende bekanntgeworden, der vielfach als \"russische Wunschliste\" kritisiert wurde. Europäer und Ukrainer verhandelten den Abkommensentwurf später mit US-Vertretern nach, mehrere Punkte blieben aber strittig. Verwendete Quellen Nachrichtenagentur dpa .... ShoppingAnzeigen ...",

            "content": "Jaquelline Grohalski levou mais do que entusiasmo para o primeiro mini desfile da Grande Rio, na noite deste domingo (30/11), na Cidade do Samba. Musa da escola, a ex-BBB e ex-Fazenda adiantou com exclusividade a este colunista do Metrópoles os detalhes do look artesanal, feito à mão com pérolas, conchas e strass. O destaque da produção é o acessório de cabeça, que pesa cerca de 4 quilos. “Estou muito animada com o Carnaval este ano, estou presente em duas escolas, vem sendo um desafio. Hoje no mini desfile vai ser o primeiro gostinho do oficial. Fizemos o look especialmente para hoje, tudo à mão, finalizamos ele agora à tarde no meu corpo”. A noite encerra a maratona de minidesfiles do Grupo Especial na Cidade do Samba, na Gamboa, que celebra antecipadamente o Dia Nacional do Samba. Neste domingo, Paraíso do Tuiuti, Unidos de Vila Isabel, Acadêmicos do Grande Rio e Acadêmicos do Salgueiro passam pela pista. O show principal é de Zeca Pagodinho. Convivência com Virginia Recém-anunciada como musa da Grande Rio, Jaquelline Grohalski comentou sobre a convivência com Virginia Fonseca, rainha de bateria da escola para o Carnaval de 2026. Em entrevista recente a este colunista do Metrópoles, a influenciadora falou sobre os primeiros contatos com Virginia e relembrou encontros anteriores. Segundo Jaquelline, as duas ainda não convivem tanto, mas ela já guarda boas memórias da família da influenciadora. A nova musa contou que essa aproximação deve aumentar agora que ambas fazem parte da rotina da escola. “Ela é muito boazinha, não convivo muito. Já tomei uma cachaça no cruzeiro com a mãe dela, maravilhosa. E ela [a Virginia], a gente só se vê em alguns eventos. Agora mais, na escola, e ela é incrível.” Jaquelline também comentou a repercussão em torno do namoro de Virginia com Vini Jr. e disse acompanhar a enxurrada de palpites nas redes sociais. Para ela, a pressão externa é algo comum para quem vive sob os holofotes. “As pessoas dão muito palpite na vida do outro, no relacionamento do outro.’. Gente, vocês nunca se apaixonaram? Porque tem gente aí com cada boy e falando mal dela. Deixem que ela seja feliz, deixem que tentem!”.",

            "content": "The highly anticipated sequel to the film adaptation of the hit musical Wicked, Wicked For Good, was a box office success. With the story arcs of Glinda and Elphaba seemingly complete, fans are now wondering what may be next for Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. Following the recent premiere of Wicked For Good, there are reportedly more plans to bring more Wicked films forward. The second half of the two-part screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical of the same name was a box office success worldwide. Wicked For Good has already brought in around £193 million (estimated over $255 million) globally. More Wicked Universe Movies Possible Speaking to Vulture, Universal's chief marketing officer Michael Moses hinted at plans to bring more movies set in the same universe. 'Because of Wicked's success but also the fanship, we almost have a responsibility to figure out how we can continue in this universe,' said Moses. 'Have we figured it out yet? No. But there are things underway.' Stephen Schwartz, the original composer and lyricist for the Broadway musical seemed to echo Moses' comments. Schwartz told The Ankler that he and Tony-winning writer Winnie Holzman, who also co-wrote both film versions, are working 'on ideas that aren't a sequel to \"Wicked.\"' 'I think the Glinda and Elphaba story feels complete, but there are other aspects that could be explored,' said Schwartz. 'Gregory Maguire, the original \"Wicked\" novelist, has several books, for example. But there's another idea that Winnie and I are discussing: Not a sequel, but an adjunct. Let me put it that way.' Ariana Grande Updates Fans on Music Career With Schwartz's comments on Glinda and Elphaba's character arcs in 'Wicked' seeming complete, fans are wondering what Grande and Erivo will be doing next. Last week, Grande hinted what might happen to her music career moving forward in an appearance on Amy Poehler's Good Hang podcast. Grande shared that her music career might take a backseat following the release of Wicked For Good and her upcoming tour. 'The last 10 or 15 years will look very different from the ones that are coming up,' Grande shared. 'I don't want to say anything definitive.' 'I do know that I'm very excited to do this small tour,' Grande continued. 'But I think it might not happen again for a long, long, long, long, long time. I'm going to give it my all, and it's going to be beautiful. I think that's why I'm doing it, because I'm like, \"One last hurrah!\"' Grande will embark on her Eternal Sunshine tour in 2026, which will accompany her 2024 album of the same name. The tour will begin in Oakland, California on 6 June 2026 and will end at the O2 Arena in London on 1 September, 2026. Cynthia Erivo Will Return to the Stage Erivo will be making her return to the stage in London in 2026. The actress will star in a one-woman stage adaptation of 'Dracula' between 4 February 2026 and 31 May 2026. Erivo will be portraying all 23 characters in this iteration of Bram Stoker's novel. She will also be appearing in several other movies, two of which will be premiering in 2027. Erivo will join Idris Elba, Viola Davis, Damson Idris, and Chiwetel Ejiofor in the big-screen adaptation of Children of Blood and Bone. She will also be part of an animated film, Bad Fairies and in another movie adaptation: this time, of the play Prima Facie, filming of which has wrapped in London.",

            "content": "Nothing's wireless earbuds haven't always impressed me, but the brand's wireless over-hear headphones are arguably the best-value options on the market. I already told you about the $79 deal for the CMF Headphone Pro which is somehow still live on Amazon after Black Friday. However, if you want to pay a bit more for a pair of headphones with way better sound and ANC, you should be looking at the Nothing Headphone 1. I thought the Nothing Headphone 1's $299 price point was aggressive when the headphones first came out. They're good enough to rival headphones like the Sonos Ace, Sony WH-1000XM6, Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2, and AirPods Max, while being considerable cheaper. That's why it's shocking that Nothing cut an extra $60 off Headphone 1 for Cyber Monday, bringing the headphones down to just $239 if you move fast. ✅Recommended if: you want a stylish pair of over-ear headphones that stand out; you like a bass-heavy sound profile with a great EQ; you want tactile buttons for simple control. ❌Skip this deal if: the 3. 5mm jack requires battery power for analog connection; sound might need some tuning out of the box. What I like about Nothing's Headphone 1 Every good pair of headphones offers great sound, but there's something special about the Nothing Headphone 1. Surprisingly, it's not that the out-of-the-box sound signature is excellent. My colleague Harish loves it, but I'd slightly prefer a more balanced profile. That leads to the best part about the Headphone 1 they're incredibly easy to personalize with a detailed eight-band EQ in the Nothing X app. You can quickly pick a few preset EQ options to immediately change the sound, or adjust each of the eight EQ bands separately with precise control. I can turn the \"more treble\" preset on to instantly make the Headphone 1 sound exactly how I want, with balance between the lows and highs. The entire experience is backed by a custom 40mm dynamic driver enclosed with 8. 9mm of polyurethane to limit distortion. Then, there are the Headphone 1's intangibles and design, which you can appreciate regardless of whether you're deep in the Nothing ecosystem. You get comfortable, soft ear cushions, an aluminum shell, and a clear plastic covering that reveals a crafted transparent design. If you have a Nothing phone already, it'll match like no other. The Nothing Headphone 1 feels comfortable and light, although its official 329-gram weight is technically on the heavier side. It goes to show how well-distributed the weight is across the headband and pads. Additionally, there is support for hi-res audio codecs like LDAC and 35-hour battery life with ANC on. Throw it all together, and Headphone 1 are a steal even at full price. When you consider the extra $60 discount for Cyber Monday? These are the best midrange headphones you can find, sitting between the cheaper CMF Headphone Pro and the more expensive Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2.",

            "content": "The Subaru Crosstrek is an excellent daily driver in a lot of ways, but it sure isn't quick. That isn't usually a problem in daily driving, but at altitude, you're going to have problems because it also isn't turbocharged. Subaru could, of course, fix that by offering the WRX's engine in the Crosstrek, but for reasons no one can fully comprehend, it refuses to do that. If you'd like to do that on your own, though, Motor1 recently spoke with a guy who WRX-swapped his Crosstrek and said it's about as close to plug-and-play as modern engine swaps get. Considering the Crosstrek is built on the same platform and closely related to the WRX, that would make sense. Then again, I haven't seen nearly as many WRX-swapped Crosstreks as I would have expected if the process really was as straightforward as it looked like it would be. I just assumed something made swapping the engine more complicated than it would appear, so people weren't as interested. But nope. As Stephen Ketslen told Motor1, putting the WRX's engine in the Crosstrek \"required absolutely no modifications-it just bolted right up.\" So if you ever find yourself with an extra WRX engine and a Crosstrek that needs said WRX engine, it sounds like all you'll need is a few tools, a little determination, an engine hoist, and a little space to perform the swap. Of course, as you've probably guessed based on the photo, Ketslen didn't stop at simply engine-swapping his Crosstrek he did his best to build a true modern WRX hatchback, and yes, that process was a bit more involved. Working with Mach V Motorsports in Virginia, Ketslen told Motor1 he started the process of making his Crosstrek quicker by buying a salvaged WRX that still had a good engine, then set about stripping both cars down in his apartment's garage before it came time to stuff all the WRX parts into the Crosstrek. As he told Motor1: I began by running the interior wiring all throughout the cabin, and feeding the bulkhead harness through the firewall,\" Stephen says. \"For the most part, everything lined up well. There were a few issues toward the rear of the car, mainly to do with making systems designed for a sedan function in a hatchback. Not having much experience with wiring, I entrusted Mach V with resolving those issues. Then it was time to swap in the rear sub-frame: I swapped the WRX's rear subframe onto the Crosstrek. Everything bolted up perfectly, and I was able to carry over most of the suspension modifications that were already on the Crosstrek before the swap. I got both cars ready for transport to Mach V, and after making sure I had everything in order, the two cars were towed to the shop in late August 2025. After that, swapping in the engine and transmission proved simple enough, although they did run into an issue with the Crosstrek's radiator core support not working with the WRX's radiator, but they were eventually able to make that work. Then they ran into issues making the body panels fit: \"The front bumper and hood fit perfectly, but the front fenders were a different story,\" he says.\"The mounting points of the fenders were not the same on both cars, so we decided to cut both fenders and re-stitch them back together such that they would mount up to the chassis correctly, but follow the body lines of the VB front end.\" So, now that the build is officially complete, how does it drive? \"For now, it behaves just like a stock VB WRX,\" Ketslen told Motor1, before adding, \"But that won't last long.\" The way he explained it, \"The goal was always more power, and while the swap nearly doubled the Crosstrek's original horsepower figure, I fully intend on adding bolt-ons and experiencing for myself what this powertrain is capable of.\" Turns out, Crosstrek owners are just like other Subaru owners. Who could have guessed? If you want to follow the VB Hatch and see how future builds go (or just tell Stephen how cool you think his car is), you can find him and the car on Instagram here. There's also plenty more to the conversation he had with Motor1, so why not head over here and give the rest of the interview a read? Meanwhile, you can also find Mach V Motorsports on Instagram here, you know, in case you need any help turning your regular, slow, boring Crosstrek into a cool, quick, fun Crosstrek WRX. I mean, clearly, they have experience doing it at least once.",

            "content": "A Dança dos Famosos definiu neste domingo (30/11) quais duplas avançaram para a grande decisão. Em uma noite marcada por performances emocionantes, os famosos Manu Bahtidão, Silvero Pereira e Wanessa Camargo garantiram a vaga na grande final, enquanto David Junior deixou a competição. Na última etapa classificatória, Wanessa Camargo e Diego Basilio; Silvero Pereira e Thais Sousa; David Junior e Jaque Paraense; e Manu Bahtidão e Heron Leal se apresentaram no estilo dança contemporânea. A disputa foi acirrada mas quem acabou com o primeiro lugar foi Silvero Pereira e Thais Souza. O programa também contou com a participação de Marcos & Belutti, cantando os grandes sucessos da dupla, Fernanda Lima, como jurada convidada da Dança dos Famosos e também uma celebração dos 25 anos de carreira de Wanessa Camargo. Dança dos Famosos 2025 A Dança dos Famosos de 2025 começou ainda em agosto, marcando 20 anos do quadro, que estreou em novembro de 2005, no antigo Domingão do Faustão (1989-2021). Atualmente exibido no Domingão com Huck, quadro deste ano ficou marcado por um elenco muito aprovado pelo público mas também por várias eliminações por lesão. Estavam escalados para o quadro: Allan Souza Lima, Alvaro, Catia Fonseca, David Junior, Duda Santos, Fernanda Paes Leme, Gracyanne Barbosa, Livinho, Luan Pereira, Manu Bahtidão, Nicole Bahls, Rodrigo Faro, Richarlyson, Silvero Pereira, Tereza Seiblitz e Wanessa. Contudo, antes mesmo da estreia, Livinho teve que deixar a competição após sofrer uma perfuração do pulmão em acidente. Ele foi substituído pelo ator Lucas Leto. Semanas depois, o programa sofreu uma segunda baixa com a saída de Gracyanne Barbosa. A musa fitness se machucou durante uma apresentação e precisou passar por uma cirurgia no joelho. Também por motivo de saúde, o cantor Luan Pereira também saiu do reality após um quadro de cálculos renais, mais conhecidos como pedras no rim.",

            "content": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. When the Miami Dolphins needed a big play on Sunday, their defense delivered. Again. Minkah Fitzpatrick had a fumble recovery and an interception, helping Miami knock off Tyler Shough and the New Orleans Saints 21-17 for their third consecutive victory. The solid performance by the defense comes after the Dolphins shut down Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills three weeks ago, and got a game-sealing interception against the Washington Commanders in Spain the following week. “I really appreciate how much this defense has been fighting,” Fitzpatrick said. “We obviously had a pretty rough start to the season. Even throughout our downs and our low periods, we were sticking together.” De’Von Achane rushed for 134 yards and a touchdown for the Dolphins (5-7), who kept their slim playoffs hopes alive. New Orleans (2-10) has lost six of seven. The Saints trailed 16-0 at halftime, but they closed to 19-17 with 1: 17 remaining on Shough’s 15-yard touchdown pass to Devaughn Vele. Shough was intercepted by Fitzpatrick on the 2-point try, and the safety returned it to the opposite end zone to give Miami two points. The rookie QB got another shot after the Saints recovered the ensuing onside kick by Charlie Smyth a former Gaelic football player from Northern Ireland making his NFL regular-season debut. But Miami’s defense stopped Shough on fourth-and-1 at the Dolphins 36 to end the game. “You hope that they can (get a stop),” Miami quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said, “and the beautiful thing is, they did. They came through for us. Regardless of what that looks like, we won the game.” Smyth connected on a 56-yard field goal to make it 19-11 with 6: 08 remaining before Shough nearly completed the comeback. Despite a poor first half that featured an interception and a strip sack, Shough finished with 239 yards and two touchdowns. “I loved our guys’ resiliency,” Saints coach Kellen Moore said. ”The way they battled. We didn’t do enough, even at the very end. It was an unfortunate ending. There is stuff to learn from and grow from during that game.” Tagovailoa was not particularly sharp, completing 12 of 23 passes for 157 yards with an interception. He leads the NFL with 14 picks, which also matches his career high from 2023. The Dolphins recorded 164 yards rushing behind Achane, who finished with 22 carries and topped 1, 000 yards for the first time in his three-year career. Achane scored his 10th touchdown of the season on a 29-yard run on Miami’s opening drive, which ended up being the team’s only TD of the afternoon. “It reverts back to how I’m playing and how I’m operating for those guys,” Tagovailoa said. “When I’m able to distribute the ball well, the operation is well. It starts with me.” The Saints, who entered the game tied for the second-worst scoring offense in the NFL, got nothing going offensively until the opening drive of the second half, when Shough capped a 10-play, 65-yard drive more than the Saints’ 63 first-half yards with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave. Shough then converted the 2-point try on a run to make it 16-8. The Dolphins didn’t respond until early in the fourth, when Tagovailoa, after nearly throwing a second interception, found Jaylen Waddle for a 22-yard pickup that set up Riley Patterson’s 33-yard kick his fourth of the day.

            "content": "Although Sir Patrick Stewart is known for his heroic on-screen efforts as the ever-diplomatic Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the Star Trek universe or Professor Charles Xavier in the 20th Century Fox Marvel universe, there's at least one occasion in film where he's been utterly reprehensible 2015's Green Room. In a rare villainous turn for the beloved actor, he plays the intimidating neo-Nazi skinhead leader Darcy Banker in the brutal horror flick, commanding his fellow white supremacists with authority and making life a living hell for an unfortunate band playing at his bar. His performance, along with the grounded, gritty violence and a strong cast around him, helped power the film to a Certified Fresh 90% Rotten Tomatoes score despite a lackluster $3. 8 million box office performance. Now, starting December 1, this modern cult classic can be streamed for free on Tubi. Green Room centers on a punk rock band called the Ain't Rights, who, after their latest gig gets cancelled, land a show at Banker's skinhead bar in the woods outside of Portland. Everything quickly goes wrong when they inadvertently discover a dead woman in the green room and try to call the police. To protect his business and ensure there are no witnesses to the crimes at hand, Banker orders his men to kill the Ain't Rights. The band is left cornered in a desperate fight for survival, seeking any way out from a bar that's crawling with white supremacists who can't be reasoned with. At the helm of Green Room was writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, who would go on to direct Netflix's Emmy-winning, Aaron Pierre-led smash hit Rebel Ridge last year. The horror flick was also produced by A24, marking an earlier example of the indie banner's horror excellence, releasing in theaters the same year as Robert Eggers' The Witch. Joining Stewart in the bloody and brutal nightmare were Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole, and Callum Turner as the members of Ain't Right, with Imogen Poots playing the murder victim's friend. Their work earned praise from the moment the film premiered at Cannes in 2015, and it would continue to earn accolades throughout the festival circuit, including the Audience Award at Fantastic Fest. Patrick Stewart Is About to Suit Up for One of His Most Iconic Roles Stewart has a big year coming up in 2026, starting with The Sheep Detectives. The mystery comedy will reunite him with his X-Men co-star Hugh Jackman, who plays a shepherd found dead under mysterious circumstances, while Stewart voices one of the sheep who put their minds together to solve it. They're just two pieces of a star-studded cast that also includes Emma Thompson, Bryan Cranston, Regina Hall, Molly Gordon, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Nicholas Galitzine, and more. However, most of the attention is on Stewart's return to the world of Marvel after getting a chair for Avengers: Doomsday earlier this year. Stewart and his fellow X-Men alumni including Sir Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Kelsey Grammer, Rebecca Romijn, and James Marsden are all set to reprise their roles and join the fight against Robert Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom in the MCU's next big team-up film, set to hit theaters on December 19, 2026. His next stint as Charles Xavier will reclaim him the title of longest-serving Marvel character actor from Jackman, though the exact details of his comeback remain a closely-guarded secret.",

            "content": "The New York Rangers’ worst fears came true on Sunday. The club announced it had placed its top blueliner on long-term injured reserve (LTIR) with an upper-body injury. Of course, that’s Adam Fox, who left Saturday night’s game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Fox sustained a hit from Brandon Hagel in the third period, leaving him writhing in pain on the ice. He left the game and did not return. While coach Mike Sullivan did not provide an update immediately following the game, the situation didn’t look good. The Rangers will now be without their best defenseman for the next 10 games at the very least. The earliest Fox could come back from his suspected shoulder injury is December 27, CBS Sports noted. That would be the best-case scenario, as renowned sports physician Harjas Grewal noted. But in the worst-case scenario, Fox may be out for much longer than that. Grewal stated: If Fox is dealing with a separated shoulder, he could be back by the end of December. But it’s a broken collarbone, the injury could pretty much end Fox’s season. That would be a crushing blow to the Rangers’ playoff hopes. The Blueshirts have already dealt with multiple injury issues this season. They’ve dealt with J. T. Miller and Vincent Trocheck going down at various points. But in Fox’s case, it could be something the club may not recover from. Rangers Can’t Really Replace Fox So, the first instinct would be to find a replacement for Adam Fox. However, Norris-Trophy-winning, right-shot defensemen don’t grow on trees. The Rangers can’t just go out and trade for someone to replace Fox. If the injury is of the short-term persuasion, the club may be able to deal with it internally. Will Borgen and Braden Schneider will be expected to step up. But if the injury proves to be of the catastrophic kind, the Rangers may need to go out and find someone on the trade market. That situation depends, of course, on whether the Rangers are within striking distance of a playoff spot. As it stands, the team has a decent shot of getting back into the race. So, it may come down to a team willing to trade a suitable defenseman. But such a move will also depend on the Rangers’ willingness to pay the price. Blueshirts Likely Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place The likeliest situation here is the Rangers being stuck between a rock and a hard place. While the club may have cap space to add, it may not have the pieces to entice another club to part with a top-four blueliner. So, what do the Blueshirts do? They’ll wait out the situation as long as possible. The goal will be to determine if Adam Fox can return at some point this season. If the team feels that the playoffs are beyond its reach, the focus may turn to landing a lottery pick instead. It’s a tough road ahead in New York, and fans may not like what’s coming down the pipeline.",

            "content": "O advogado João Maurício Costa reivindicou a autoria da ação popular que resultou na decisão liminar da 5ª Vara da Fazenda Pública de Salvador suspendendo o edital da Secretaria da Saúde da Bahia (Sesab) para seleção de estudantes baianos em um curso de medicina na Escola Latino-Americana de Medicina (Elam), em Cuba. A suspensão foi determinada na última quarta-feira (26) pelo juiz Marcelo de Oliveira Brandão. Segundo João Maurício, a liminar foi proferida na ação popular de sua autoria (nº 8223543-20. 2025. 8. 05. 0001), e não na ação posterior movida pelo deputado estadual Leandro de Jesus (PL), apontado inicialmente como responsável pelo processo. “O deputado também ingressou com uma ação popular, mas foi posterior à minha”, disse o advogado. Consultando o documento da decisão do juiz Marcelo Brandão, a reportagem confirmou que a ação movida pelo advogado foi a que ocasionou na suspensão do edital. Ainda assim, o deputado declarou não ter conseguido contato com o advogado. No mesmo diálogo, João Maurício afirma ter convidado Leandro de Jesus a ingressar como assistente no processo que possuem “a mesma intenção judicial”. O advogado sustenta que sua ação popular encontra-se mais avançada no rito processual e que, por esse motivo, a demanda do parlamentar pode ser encerrada pelo magistrado, por existir processo idêntico tramitando anteriormente na mesma vara.",

            "content": "Trinity Shockley, 19, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after plotting a mass shooting at her high school in Indiana. In a dramatic reminder of the power of vigilance and timely intervention, the 19-year-old will serve time behind bars after being convicted for plotting a mass shooting at Mooresville High School. According to reports, Shockley became emotional in court as she learned her fate. More specifically, she will be spending 12 years in prison for a crime that she did not technically commit but had actively planned. The Plot that Was Foiled According to court records, the plan was chilling: Shockley had considered carrying out a mass shooting at her former high school on Valentine's Day this year. The tip revealed that the trans woman had access to an AR-15 rifle, purchased a bulletproof vest, and expressed her profound admiration for an infamous school shooter. Police say the planning had been ongoing for about a year. Court documents, they added, included disturbing references to mass violence, and evidence uncovered in her home reportedly included violent materials and a fixation on previous mass killers. Shockley was arrested earlier this year before any harm could come to innocent students and staff. Justice Delivered Last week, Shockley pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, which is a level 2 felony. After considering the evidence and the level of planning, the court handed down a 20-year sentence, with eight years suspended, resulting in 12 years to serve. This will be followed by a 5-year probation period. During the sentencing, Shockley became emotional. She apologised to her intended target and the community, saying she was sorry for 'putting you in that position of fear.' Her defence argued she never actually intended to carry out the attack and that it was all talk, not action. However, prosecutors fired back by saying that the seriousness and detail of her planning left no doubt about the danger posed. In a statement following the case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) office in Indianapolis praised the tipster, emphasising that speaking out helped save lives. Mental Health and Warning Signs During the proceedings, it was revealed that Shockley suffered from bullying and mental health challenges. These conditions reportedly contributed to her radicalisation and obsession with school shooting content, according to WIBC. Psychologists and the court recognised that her online engagement with violent subcultures, fascination with previous mass shooters, and access to weaponry created a dangerous cocktail. The judge overseeing the case warned that, but for the intervention, February 14 could have ended as a 'day of irreversible harm.' School Shootings in the US The year isn't over yet, but there have already been 70 reported school shootings in 2025. According to CNN, 41 of these shootings took place on college campuses, while 29 took place in K-12 grounds. A total of 27 people were killed in the shootings, and over 100 were injured. The publication revealed that the number of school shooting incidents saw a decline only during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, simply because students were attending school online.",

            "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. The Jacksonville Jaguars are showing how quickly a franchise can turn around in a coach’s first season. Trevor Lawrence threw for 229 yards and two touchdowns and the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Tennessee Titans 25-3 Sunday for their third straight victory. With the win, the Jaguars (8-4) improved their AFC playoff hopes while chasing their first division title since 2022. This put the Jaguars atop the division with two games left against Indianapolis, and the Colts fell to 8-4 with a 20-16 loss to Houston. “We’re giving ourselves an opportunity to play meaningful games in November and December, and ultimately that’s all you can ask for in this league,” Jaguars first-year coach Liam Coen said. “The rest of the way you’ve got competitive, meaningful football games.” The Jaguars also beat the Titans for the sixth time in seven games that left them nitpicking over not finishing this win better. “We’re happy we won,” Lawrence said. “No doubt about that. We come here to win ‚and that’s what we did. But to even have that feeling of like, ‘Man just didn’t finish clean,’ like I think that shows the maturity of the team too.” Josh Hines-Allen had two of Jacksonville’s three sacks of rookie Cam Ward, and the Jaguars recovered two fumbles even with the defensive line missing end Travon Walker and tackle Arik Armstead because of injuries. “That’s where we took a step today for our identity of our team of we can be a front-runner and go win the games we should win,” Jaguars safety Andrew Wingard said. The Titans (1-11) lost their seventh straight overall and 11th consecutive at home, matching the longest such skid since this franchise moved to Tennessee. They also lost 11 in a row at Nissan Stadium in a stretch over the 2014 and 2015 seasons. Fans booed the Titans early and often before heading to the exits well before the end. “We’ve got to do a better job all around,” said Titans interim coach Mike McCoy who’s still looking for his first win after six losses. “It was sloppy. Lawrence threw a 3-yarder to Jakobi Meyers putting the Jaguars ahead to stay late in the first quarter. He threw a 21-yard TD pass to Brenton Strange on the third play after LeQuint Allen Jr. forced and recovered a fumble on a kickoff. After a penalty, Lawrence ran for a 2-point conversion and a 15-3 lead to start the second quarter. Meyers led the Jaguars with six catches for 90 yards. This was his first game with wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr., who was back after missing two games with an injured ankle since Meyers was added from Las Vegas at the trade deadline. Tennessee led 3-0 after a 28-yard field goal by Joey Slye. Bhayshul Tuten padded the Jaguars’ lead to 25-3 with a 2-yard TD run with 6: 45 left in the third quarter. That drive was kept alive by a roughing the punter penalty on Mike Brown when the Jaguars faced fourth-and-20 from their 19. Flag day Brown was ejected after a bit of a scrum after a Jaguars punt in the fourth quarter. Officials huddled up after settling everyone down, then handed out personal fouls to Brown and Julius Chestnut with the Titans and to Jaguars punter Logan Cooke and long snapper Ross Matiscik. The Titans hurt themselves with 10 penalties. Linebacker Arden Key’s roughing the passer gave the Jaguars points with Cam Little hitting a 45-yard field goal on an untimed down for an 18-3 lead at halftime. The Jaguars matched their season high with 13 penalties. “It’s just a division game, division rivals,” Titans defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons said. “The Jags don’t like the Titans, the Titans don’t like the Jags.” Injuries Matisick hurt his back early in the first quarter and returned in the third quarter. WR Patrick Washington hurt a hip in the first half and didn’t return. Left tackle Walker Little missed the second half after being evaluated for a concussion. He was replaced by Cole Van Lanen. Cooke returned after being evaluated for a concussion. Titans receiver Xavier Restrepo was being evaluated after hurting his right ankle with 2: 26 left. He was carted off the field. Titans safety Amani Hooker hurt a rib late in the game. Up next The Jaguars host Indianapolis on Dec. 7. The Titans visit Cleveland on Dec. 7. ___.",

Boxer Jake Paul took a jab at Lane Kiffin after the college football coach decided to jump at the opportunity to take the LSU Tigers’ job and leave the Ole Miss Rebels on Sunday. Kiffin made the decision hours after Ole Miss defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs in their Egg Bowl rivalry game and virtually solidifying a spot in the College Football Playoff. Paul was among those who believed that Kiffin made a mistake. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS. COM \"Lane Kiffin wtf did you just do such an L,\" he wrote on X. \"Feel bad for the players man.\" Ole Miss players didn’t appear to be too broken up by Kiffin’s move. Offensive lineman Brycen Saunders appeared to be excited that Pete Golding was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach as the team prepares for the College Football Playoff. \"LFG! @KeithCarterOM best AD in the nation, and couldn't be more excited to play for Coach Golding,\" Saunders wrote on X. Kiffin released a statement on his decision to leave Ole Miss for LSU. He said that he wanted to coach Ole Miss through the rest of the season, but was denied by Carter. 2025 HEISMAN TROPHY ODDS: JULIAN SAYIN, FERNANDO MENDOZA NECK AND NECK \"After a lot of prayer and time spent with family, I made the difficult decision to accept the head coaching position at LSU,\" Kiffin said in a statement. \"I was hoping to complete a historic six-season run with this year's team by leading Ole Miss through the playoffs, capitalizing on the team's incredible success and their commitment to finish strong, and investing everything into a playoff run with guardrails in place to protect the program in any areas of concern. My request to do so was denied by Keith Carter despite the team also asking him to allow me to keep coaching them so they could better maintain their high level of performance. Unfortunately, that means Friday's Egg Bowl was my last game coaching the Rebels. \"While I am looking forward to a new start with a unique opportunity at LSU, I will forever cherish the incredible six years I spent at Ole Miss and will be rooting hard for the team to complete their mission and bring a championship to Oxford.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE.",

El equipo de Francesco Farioli dejó decidido el partido en el minuto 7 después de que su extremo izquierdo William Gomes sorprendiera a los 'canariños' apareciendo en el área tras un pase hacia atrás del jugador rival Jordan Holsgrove que el brasileño interceptó y aprovechó para rematar con disparo raso. Gol anulado a Samu Y podría haber sido por más ventaja si un tanto de cabeza marcado en el minuto 5 por Samu Aghegowa no hubiera sido anulado por fuera de juego. Pese estar por delante en el marcador durante todo el partido, no fue un partido fácil para los 'dragones', ya que el Estoril buscó el gol sin fortuna creando varias situaciones de peligro en la portería de Diogo Costa, que se tuvo que afanar para evitar el empate. Con este triunfo en la duodécima jornada de la Primeira Liga, el Porto se mantiene primero en la clasificación con 34 puntos, seguido del Sporting, con 31, tras imponerse también hoy al Estrela Amadora (4-0) y el Benfica de José Mourinho, con 28.",

            "content": "Cameron Smith's 2025 season hasn't panned out the way he would have expected. Last Friday, the LIV Golfer missed the cut at the Australian PGA Championship. This naturally was a setback since Smith was playing in his country. Ad However, what makes the whole story a bit more bothersome is that Smith has missed the cut in all four Major championships he played as well. After his campaign at the Australian PGA Championship ended, Smith expressed his frustration and seemed clueless. Thanks for the submission! In a conversation with Australian Golf Digest, Cameron Smith said: “It can definitely get in your head, I think it is in my head, It’s just frustrating. It’s been my story of the year, feel I’ve worked hard all year and got nothing out of it. I do know what the answer is, it’s just to keep working hard and try to be patient. I’ve tried to do all the right stuff, for whatever reason it’s not coming together on the course.” Ad Trending NUCLR GOLF @NUCLRGOLF 🚨❌🇦🇺 #IN MY HEAD LIV Golf star Cam Smith is frustrated with his game after he missed the cut at his hometown Australian PGA Championship. “It can definitely get in your head, I think it is in my head, It’s just frustrating. It’s been my story of the year, feel I’ve worked Ad Cameron Smith's recent slump in performance has been a shock for golf fans around the world. At one point in his career, Smith was ranked No. 2 in the world and enjoyed many famous victories. Sadly, however, the 32-year-old seems to struggle making the cut as of today. Cameron Smith opens up on playing the Australian Open alongside Rory McIlroy & other pros Starting December 4th, the Royal Melbourne GC will play host to the Crown Australian Open. While the tournament is set to feature Cameron Smith, it will also witness big names like Career Grand Slam winner Rory McIlroy play. Ad In his conversation with Australian Golf Digest, Smith expressed excitement about the tournament but also said he won't be traveling to Melbourne early despite missing the cut. He said: “I’m due to Melbourne Monday anyway, which is plenty of time. I’ve played a lot of golf down there. I feel like I don’t need to rush.” Smith also shared his thoughts on how the event would be. He added: Ad “I was already excited to be there really; it’s going to be a great event, starting to come into its own and I’m excited to get down there and give it a crack.\" The Australian Open is one tournament Cameron Smith has never won in his professional golf career. While Smith might be going through a rough patch on the golf course, one can never truly count him out. For all you know, the Australian Open is where the LIV Golfer redeems himself. × Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "A British man was arrested and harassed by local police after posing with a shotgun while on vacation in Florida. Jon Richelieu-Booth, a 55-year-old IT contractor, had uploaded a picture of himself holding firearms at a Florida homestead on August 13. What should have been nothing more than a LinkedIn holiday snap instead triggered a 13-week saga, starting with officers turning up at his home to warn him about how online content might affect people’s feelings. After offering them proof the photos were taken in America, poliuce went ahead and arrested him on August 24. Even after all charges were dropped, officers came back to his house after 10pm that night and arrested him again. Bail paperwork accused him of having guns “to frighten” and of stalking because he had posted a picture of a property online. In the weeks that followed, officers returned to his home three more times. In October, he was arrested again for supposedly breaching bail. Prosecutors then tried pursuing him over a separate social media post, alleging a public order offence. He was due in Bradford magistrates’ court on November 25, but that case was also withdrawn. With his electronic devices seized, Richelieu-Booth says even his IT work was brought to a halt. “I’ve been put through 13 weeks of hell,” he told The Yorkshire Post. “When did we go from a society where you can have a discussion with somebody and go, ‘You know what? I don’t like your opinion. I’m going to disagree with you, but I’m not going to tell you why, I’m going to call the police.’” “I will be filing a case against the police,” he added. “I will be seeking quite a lot of damages.” West Yorkshire Police declined to comment, saying it “wouldn’t be appropriate to comment” while a formal complaint may be underway. The case has drawn attention from Elon Musk, who said it was further evidence of why America needs the Second Amendment.",

            "content": "Carlos Santana sempre foi conhecido pela segurança com que domina a guitarra e pela naturalidade com que transita entre rock, blues e música latina. Mas há um nome diante do qual até ele admite perder o chão: Wayne Shorter. Em uma entrevista de 2022 resgatada pela Far Out, Santana explicou que ouvir o lendário saxofonista o coloca em um estado de total humildade artística: \"Ouvir a música dele me faz sentir como uma criança de dois anos, como se eu não soubesse nada sobre música\", afirmou. Santana Mais Novidades CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE CLI Segundo ele, a arquitetura musical de Shorter é tão complexa e sofisticada que o obriga a repensar tudo o que sabe: \"Preciso entender a ordem arquitetônica de alguém como Wayne Shorter. Preciso sair do berço e descobrir como aquela ordem se relaciona.\" Santana disse compreender profundamente o universo do blues, mas que Shorter o motivou a buscar novos ciclos harmônicos e expandir seu vocabulário musical: \"Eu entendo o blues, mas preciso aprender mais ciclos. Estou tentando me esticar um pouco na guitarra agora, dar esse salto para um novo nível. Não sei se vou conseguir ou fracassar, mas estou com fome disso.\" CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE GOO Segundo Lauren Hunter, que assina o texto, a admiração de Santana vinha de longe. \"Shorter ocupava uma posição singular no jazz, tendo integrado o Second Great Quintet de Miles Davis e formado o Weather Report ao lado de Jaco Pastorius e Joe Zawinul. Sua música, marcada por liberdade estrutural e rigor estético, sempre exerceu forte influência sobre músicos de diferentes áreas\", disse. Santana lamentou nunca ter tido a chance de entender diretamente o que seu ídolo pensava de sua obra Shorter morreu em 2023 -, mas deixou claro que sua inspiração permanece intacta. Para ele, Shorter representa o tipo de genialidade capaz de impactar até os músicos mais experientes. CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE CLI.",

Author Gregory Maguire, whose 1995 novel inspired the Broadway phenomenon-turned-Universal blockbuster starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, is returning to the land of Oz with a prequel novel exploring the beginnings of the Good Witch. Titled Galinda: A Charmed Childhood, the HarperCollins book is set for release Sept. 29, 2026. Billed as a sister volume to the No. 1 New York Times-bestselling Elphie: A Wicked Childhood, which naturally explores the origins of the Wicked Witch, Galinda promises to tell the tale of the girl “behind the bubbly, shallow cliché.” Its synopsis is as follows: “The youngest of four children in a high-born family down on their luck, Galinda is both pampered and ignored. Her natural grace promises to elevate her in the district dance competitions-but these efforts distract her from seeing the growing resentments of local merchants who disapprove of her family’s business strategies. Enmired in the self-satisfactions and unnamed timidities of childhood, Galinda finds in herself neither canniness nor the need to cultivate it. However, as her father deftly pivots around the snares and nets laid for him by his competitors, Galinda begins to dance toward a life that might lift her above her proud, if hardscrabble, childhood.” Per the publisher and its imprint William Morrow, limited deluxe hardcover editions are currently available, featuring stenciled edges, designed endpapers and more, as long as supplies last. Wicked: For Good beat a number of records set by its predecessor, last year’s Wicked, with an opening of $147M domestic, and $223M worldwide. Though stars Grande and Erivo have bid goodbye to their dearly held characters, Universal CMO Michael Moses told Vulture the studio is already machinating for an Oz-related cinematic universe of sorts. “Because of Wicked’s success but also the fanship, we have almost a responsibility to figure out how we can continue in this universe,” he told the outlet. “Have we figured it out yet? No. But there are things underway.” Wicked 2 featured glimpses into Galinda’s childhood. In an early birthday scene, Galinda receives a wand as a gift, and upon the urging of her friends to perform a spell, finds she is unable to do so. Backed into a corner, Galinda lies and says a chance rainbow was the result of her magical prowess. When she later expresses her fears and disappointment to her parents, they dismiss her worries and encourage her to focus on her innate charms and smile.",

            "content": "MADRID (AP) Real Madrid failed to return to the top of the Spanish league on Sunday after being held 1-1 at relegation-threatened Girona. Kylian Mbappé converted a 67th-minute penalty after Azzedine Ounahi had put the hosts ahead in the 45th at Montilivi Stadium. Mbappé, who scored four goals midweek against Olympiakos in the Champions League, almost won it for Madrid when his right-footed strike from near the penalty spot just missed deep into stoppage time. “I liked how the team reacted, even though it wasn’t enough to get the win,” Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said. “In the second half we improved and we could’ve won coming from behind. We couldn’t finish the chances we created.” Madrid complained it should have had a penalty in the 80th after a challenge on Rodrygo. It was the third straight league draw for Madrid, which relinquished the league lead on Saturday after Barcelona beat Alaves 3-1. Barcelona is one point ahead of Madrid after 14 matches. Girona, which is 18th, has won only one of its last six league games. Villarreal wins late Alberto Moleiro scored five minutes into stoppage-time as third-placed Villarreal extended its league winning streak to five matches with a 3-2 victory at Real Sociedad. Villarreal was leading 2-0 before the hosts hit back with goals in the 60th and 87th. Moleiro netted the winner with a shot from the edge of the area deep into added time. Villarreal is one point behind Madrid and one point ahead of fourth-placed Atletico Madrid, which beat last-placed Oviedo 2-0 on Saturday. Sociedad, which stayed ninth, had won three of its last four matches. Trouble at Seville derby Second-half goals from Pablo Fornals and Sergi Altimira gave Real Betis a 2-0 win at Sevilla in the Seville derby. The victory moved Betis to fifth. Sevilla, which has lost five of its last six league games, stayed 13th. The match was stopped for more than 15 minutes and players were sent to the locker rooms after objects were thrown onto the field by Sevilla fans behind one of the goals. Also Sunday, Kike García scored an 86th-minute winner for sixth-placed Espanyol in a 1-0 win at 12th-placed Celta Vigo. ___ AP soccer:.",

            "content": "Conversar com Rudolf Schenker é entender que o Scorpions nunca foi \"apenas\" uma banda de hard rock. Em mais de seis décadas de estrada, os alemães tocaram em mais de 80 países, ajudaram a embalar a queda do Muro de Berlim e ainda hoje lotam arenas como se estivessem no auge dos anos 1980. Mas, se fosse preciso escolher um único instante que resume tudo o que o Scorpions representa, o fundador não titubeia: o US Festival de 1983, na Califórnia. Em entrevista a Marcelo Vieira em parceria com o Whiplash. Net, Rudolf relembrou que aquele show surgiu em um momento decisivo. A banda estava em estúdio gravando \"Love at First Sting\" quando recebeu o convite para ser co-headliner de um festival histórico, dividindo o topo da noite com o Van Halen. \"Tivemos que interromper as gravações porque 'No One Like You' era um grande hit nos Estados Unidos\", contou o guitarrista, lembrando que, antes deles, ainda subiam ao palco nomes como Ozzy Osbourne e Triumph. Scorpions Mais Novidades CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE CLI Scorpions e \"Love at First Sting\" O que aconteceu a seguir, na visão de Schenker, foi o ponto de virada. Diante de mais de 360 mil pessoas, o Scorpions entrou em cena com impacto cinematográfico. \"Ganhamos a atenção do público com cinco jatos sobrevoando o palco, e o anúncio: 'Senhoras e senhores, diretamente da Alemanha: Scorpions!'\", recordou. Para ele, aquela resposta imediata da plateia, em um festival dominado por gigantes americanos, selou o lugar da banda no mapa do rock mundial. \"Fomos os reis daquele festival\", resume. CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE GOO O efeito do US Festival não ficou restrito àquela noite. Um ano depois, o grupo lançaria \"Love at First Sting\", com \"Rock You Like a HurricaneStill Loving YouBig City Nights\" e outros clássicos que consolidariam de vez o Scorpions como um dos grandes nomes globais do hard rock. Rudolf lembra que a banda perseguia essa meta desde o começo. \"Quando um jornalista me perguntou em 1971 qual era meu objetivo, respondi: 'Ser uma das 30 maiores bandas de rock do mundo'. E chegamos lá.\" Na mesma entrevista, Schenker deixa claro que aquele show californiano não foi um golpe de sorte, mas resultado de um jeito de trabalhar. Ele fala de energia, disciplina e de como meditação e ioga o ajudaram a tomar decisões importantes, como cantar em inglês quando os próprios alemães zombavam disso, ou insistir em tocar em outros países quando o mercado local ainda não abraçava a banda. O US Festival foi, portanto, a síntese perfeita: uma banda alemã, com mentalidade global, provando diante de centenas de milhares de pessoas que podia competir de igual para igual com qualquer gigante americano. CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE CLI Hoje, aos 76 anos, girando a Flying V no palco \"como se fosse um garoto em seu primeiro festival\", como descreve Marcelo Vieira, Rudolf enxerga aquele dia na Califórnia como o momento em que o Scorpions mostrou ao mundo quem realmente era. Energia, ambição, presença de palco e uma coleção de músicas prontas para se tornarem hinos tudo isso estava ali. Se é para escolher uma cena que represente a essência dos alemães, para ele não há dúvida: foi sob o sol da Califórnia, diante de 360 mil pessoas, que o Scorpions virou, de fato, o Scorpions.

            "content": "Analyst Weekly, December 1, 2025 Consumer Stocks: The Sleeper Trade Heading Into 2026 Consumers have looked gloomy on the surface: confidence readings are hovering near cycle lows, layoffs keep making headlines, and affordability stress is real. But under the hood, the US consumer is gearing up for one of the biggest stimulus tailwinds since the pandemic. Retail investors should pay attention. A Strong Consumer Tailwind Meets Cyclical Risk Starting February 2026, roughly $150 billion in fresh stimulus is projected to flow into US households through enhanced tax refunds and policy changes. That’s nearly pandemic-level support, and it hits right as households look stretched. Refund season already packs a punch in normal years. For lower- and middle-income consumers, the most sensitive to cash flow, refunds drive everything from sneakers and electronics to used cars and vacations. Now imagine refund checks almost 45% higher than last year. That could be the spending catalyst the market isn’t fully pricing in. Sectors and companies most exposed to tax-season behavior? Discount retailers (think companies that cite refund season as a demand driver: G, URL, SS, JX, CVL, OST), autos highly sensitive to refund-related spending (MX, ZO), gaming (YD, KNG), value travel (KNG, CL), fast fashion (KE, ROX) and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)-linked names (FRM, MZN). Many of these companies have openly said their customers respond to refund timing, and they’ve been bracing for a lift. Investment Takeaway: This consumer boost doesn’t stand alone. When combined with the broader fiscal package for 2026, plus a Federal Reserve that may lower rates and prepare to shift from balance-sheet reduction to gradual expansion, the backdrop could become more supportive for spending and risk assets. Greater liquidity and lighter tax burdens tend to benefit smaller, consumer-sensitive companies in particular. The main risk to this outlook is straightforward: if employment weakens more than anticipated, the spending lift from refunds and tax changes may not fully materialize. Investors should balance that tailwind against employment and fiscal-timing risks as they position portfolios. Consumers Feel Down, but They Haven’t Stopped Spending Consumer sentiment surveys are sitting at levels typically associated with economic slowdowns. Yet actual spending patterns and corporate earnings tell a different story. Many large US companies continue to report rising profits, showing that demand has held up better than the mood would suggest. That disconnect between how consumers report feeling and how they are actually spending has been a notable feature of this cycle. Historically, gaps like this tend to narrow over time sometimes because sentiment eventually improves, and other times because spending slows to match the softer mood. At this stage, spending data and corporate results indicate that consumer activity has held up better than sentiment surveys might imply, though it remains uncertain how long that resilience will persist. Meanwhile, small-cap US stocks are trading at unusually steep valuation discounts to large caps, levels not seen in many years. Those depressed valuations reflect low expectations. If consumer activity steadies or improves, smaller companies, which are more sensitive to shifts in household demand, could see outsized upside because the bar for good news is so low. Investor Takeaway: For investors who think the consumer is strained but not collapsing, this backdrop may create a potentially attractive environment for selective exposure within consumer-linked areas of the market. Large, liquid beneficiaries could include MZN, APL, KE, MUS, KNG, CL, while small caps may offer optionality if spending stabilizes. Bitcoin Is Starting to Behave Like a Large-Cap Asset Recent data from Ecoinometrics points to a notable shift in how bitcoin trades. Historically, its downside and volatility were driven mostly by macro cycles and on-chain activity. Today, the picture is more mixed: ETF flows have become a central part of the pricing mechanism, giving bitcoin characteristics that look increasingly similar to a traditional institutional asset. A narrower trading range signals a different market structure In a base-case environment where ETF outflows stabilize, bitcoin appears comfortable in a relatively contained range: roughly around $72k to $85k. Earlier cycles rarely produced that kind of consistency. Its trading dynamics now reflect a broader, more diversified investor base. Three structural changes are driving this behavior: Volatility has moderated over the past several years, making bitcoin’s profile resemble that of a large-cap risk asset more than an early-stage technology bet. The “digital gold” narrative has encouraged greater institutional participation through regulated ETF vehicles. These factors together create what could be described as a more balanced trading environment, not immune to swings, but less dependent on crypto-native catalysts alone. However, flow-driven markets cut both ways A secondary scenario also matters. If ETF outflows persist, the pressure on price would come less from crypto-specific concerns and Investor takeaway: Bitcoin is moving into a regime where traditional market variables such as liquidity, regulation, fiscal conditions, and institutional sentiment, carry as much weight as on-chain signals. For investors, this means a potentially more predictable asset than in past cycles, but also one more sensitive to shifts in ETF demand and broader risk appetite. It’s less about forecasting a specific price path and more about understanding the market structure now shaping bitcoin’s trading behavior. EURUSD: Lift from the Support Zone What Matters Now EURUSD rose 0. 74% last week to 1. 1602. The pair recently turned just below the 1. 15 level, right within a long-term support zone (Fair Value Gap) on the daily chart. The broader uptrend remains intact, but the medium-term structure still shows a series of lower highs and lower lows. A sustained breakout above 1. 1668 would be needed to break this pattern. If that fails, the pair risks slipping back into the mentioned support zone. Tension is rising this week, as the economic calendar is packed with important data releases from the US and Europe. Volatility is almost guaranteed. Monday: US ISM Manufacturing PMI will the index remain below the critical 50 mark? Tuesday: Eurozone inflation data expected to rise to 2. 2% YoY, still close to the ECB’s target. Wednesday: US ISM Services PMI key to assessing whether the services sector remains strong. Thursday: Eurozone retail sales an important indicator of consumer sentiment and an early signal for the upcoming holiday season. Friday: Core PCE Price Index the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, keeping markets on edge until the end of the week. EURUSD, daily chart. Alphabet’s share price posted strong gains last week, rising 7. 1% to $320. 12. At one point, it even climbed to $332. 14, a new all-time high. Technically, many factors point to a continuation of the trend. At the same time, the upward move is now stretched. Since the April low, Alphabet has gained around 125% without any meaningful pullbacks. This increases the likelihood of short-term profit-taking. If a counter-move occurs, two support zones (Fair Value Gaps) are particularly important: $294. 48-$304. 54 a decline into this area would be a healthy correction within the uptrend. $262. 10-$273. 00 a drop into this zone would resemble a bear-market scenario. In short: The long-term uptrend remains intact, but the risk of a pullback is rising. Alphabet, weekly chart. Source: eToro.",

            "content": "The Minnesota Vikings did everything in their power to start the season on the right foot, including a trade with the Carolina Panthers to reunite with Adam Thielen. Thielen was tapped to replace Jordan Addison for the first three games of the season with Addison serving a suspension. Long-term, the hope was Thielen could provide veteran experience and depth at wide receiver. However, on Sunday, November 30, Thielen was inactive for a Week 13 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks, his first healthy scratch of the season. Since the Vikings’ Week 6 bye, Thielen has played just 44 snaps in six games. He’s caught eight of 18 targets this season for 69 yards receiving and has three drops to his name. For comparison, Thielen has dropped three or fewer passes across five of his nine seasons as a full-time starter, per Pro Football Focus. Thielen’s lack of production and the cost to acquire him in the trade has been a bane to fans all season that hoped to see the longtime franchise icon close his career on a high note. Sunday’s healthy scratch was the coda to fans’ frustrations amid a 4-7 start to the season. Vikings Fans React to Adam Thielen Benching After Costly Trade In August, the Vikings traded conditional fourth- and fifth-round picks to land Thielen. They also received conditional fifth- and seventh-round picks. “I thought the Adam Thielen trade made sense at the time, even if it was a bit of an overpay. Just hasn’t aged well at all since then. Only 8 catches for Thielen this season, and now he’s a healthy scratch,” Sports Illustrated’s Will Ragatz wrote in a post on X that drew widespread feedback from fans. “A lot of personnel decisions made sense at the time and haven’t aged well at all. Seems every button pushed this year was the wrong one,” one fan replied. “He was getting waaay too much love when they brought him back here, dude was a deteriorating 35 yr old WR,” a second fan said. “I hate seeing Adam Thielen being a healthy scratch. We’re truly at the end of the road,” another fan wrote in an X post. While Thielen’s lack of production was a surprise, it’s also a symptom of the entire Vikings offense’s struggles this season. “People complaining about Adam thielen are hilarious. We’re struggling to pass for 150 yards and people are like “our 4th receiver isn’t doing anything!!” one fan wrote previously. Vikings Rookie WR Tai Felton Hasn’t Found the Field Despite Thielen’s Step Back A 2025 third-round pick, Tai Felton has not seen the field as much as fans hoped. Felton has played primarily a special teams role through his first NFL season. Through 11 games, Felton has played 202 special teams snaps and only 18 snaps on offense. Felton is buried in a deep wide receiver room that has seen Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and Jalen Nailor dominate reps.",

            "content": "Most people know of Michael Knowles as one of the marquee personalities in a stable of strong conservative influencers at The Daily Wire. There are a lot of descriptors you can use to describe him, from “conservative” and “author,” to Yale alum, to free speech advocate. And while he’s hardly the only Catholic conservative media figure, there’s something a little different in how he incorporates his faith into his work. Just off the top of my head, I can think of any number of young conservatives who unapologetically wear their Catholicism on their sleeves, from Jack Posobiec to Knowles’ colleague at The Daily Wire, Matt Walsh. To be clear, there is nothing wrong with the way anyone decides to factor their personal faith in their media work. But it’s actually refreshing that we’re seeing more younger people make their Catholic faith a part of their media persona instead of relegating it with a hard line to their private lives never to be mentioned in public. This approach to matters of faith has been long overdue, and thanks to Knowles, Walsh, Posobiec, and others like Charlie Kirk and Allie Beth Stuckey, Jesus has had some really strong advocates of late, and He’s needed them. What’s interesting about Knowles, however, is the way he does it. Let’s start with his origin story on his faith as I understand it from just listening to his podcast. Born in 1990, Knowles is a millennial from New York, He’s a graduate of Yale University, where he majored in history and Italian literature. For a period of time in his younger years, he was a self-professed atheist, but that changed when, as a young adult, he started looking for answers to questions, and that quest eventually took him back to the Catholic faith. If you listen to his show, you will likely hear any number of references to literature through the ages, great philosophers, and sometimes more history on the Catholic Church than almost any other podcast host who isn’t solely focused on religion. What makes this worth thinking about is that intentionally or unintentionally (I can’t read his mind), it would appear he’s bringing more people into the Catholic faith than I’ve seen a media personality do in my lifetime, and I’m.(clears throat). older than Knowles. And he’s doing it in ways the church itself shies away from. He hits the issues head on, he often leaves little-to-no ambiguity, and he’s a firm advocate for and defender of some of the church’s more traditional rites, practices, and teachings. As a result, even church institutions which have tended not to stand up for themselves, have had to stand by and watch people like Knowles and other usually young conservative Catholics do it for them. What I like about Knowles and some of the other young Catholic voices in conservative media is that it feels like the spirit of Saint Paul lives. Paul famously took a no-BS approach to matters of public discourse over the faith. It would appear he didn’t suffer fools gladly. Yet at the same time, he knowingly put himself out there and was willing to deal with the consequences for doing so. In that spirit, Knowles, Walsh, and Posobiec, in particular, have taken a lot of heat for espousing values and concepts that not long ago were the norm for a society that was more aspirational and held itself to higher standards. Insofar as Catholicism is concerned, Knowles, however, has taken this to another level, a sort of \"ministry.\" You hear it in his speech, his monologues, and his commentary. But where you hear it most clearly and consistently is during a regular feature on his show -- his \"mailbag\" -- where he takes listener questions. Sometimes the questions are submitted in writing; other times, the audience hears pre-recorded audio submissions from listeners like them. Based on these questioners, it seems an unusually high number of Knowles’ listeners are young, probably Gen Z and millennials like himself, and they are thinking very deeply and quite a bit about their relationship with their faith. They seek Knowles’ advice on matters of faith, faith policy, and even how to put some of these things into practice in their own lives. Some of these questions are very heavy and deeply personal. It's not uncommon for listeners to seek out Knowles' religious perspective on whether they should or should not marry the person they are seeing. Knowles almost never holds back. While not scolding his audience, he’s not afraid to tell it likes he sees it, and how he understands it, without reinterpreting church doctrine or dogma to suit himself. He’s a regular attendee to the Latin mass, a traditional rite that pre-dates the “1962 Roman Missal” that came out of Vatican II. Vatican II ushered in the practice of having the priest face the congregation, instead of the tabernacle at the front of the church, and to speak in the language of attendees instead of Latin. Libs might say this made the mass “more accessible” to the people, but Knowles has been quick to point out that in the Latin mass, which is a very beautiful service, it’s not that the priest’s back is to the pews, but rather, his back is not to the tabernacle, where the consecrated hosts of the Blessed Sacrament are kept. Knowles has found a way to blend his conservative politics with what some describe as the views of a “Catholic apologist.” Knowles puts it this way when describing the need to express our faith in our own public life, as part of a community: . we need to insist upon standards and norms that are properly Catholic, that is conducive to everyone’s flourishing. And we need to stop buying the nonsense fed to us by late 19th and late 20th century politicians who want to pretend that the American political order is supposed to exclude religion. That is not true today. That never has been true. And the very fact that our country is much more open to Catholicism than it has. We have a practicing Catholic vice president, for instance, something that most people would have thought was not imaginable. We can continue to promote that, and the secularists and the atheists can whine and scream. But the actual American political tradition, I think, is on our side. We just have to have the courage to follow it. If you listen to Knowles often enough, you’re likely to get a drip-by-drip education on Catholicism. But is this having an effect? I think it is. All you have to do is hear some of those questioners on his show. Many are lapsed Catholics who are now reconsidering jumping back in, but they want Knowles to answer some questions for them. Or they are people who haven’t had a strong religious upbringing or background, and their questions indicate they’re giving some serious thought to joining a 2, 000-year-old church that’s usually written off as being out of touch with the modern world. But how does that explain all of those young people who are becoming Catholic now? Certainly, the trend is much, much bigger than a single podcaster. But still, I don’t think it would be fair to underestimate the role Michael Knowles is playing in America.",

            "content": "San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy said he often annoys his wife in the kitchen by hitting The Dougie dance. But like the rest of the football world, tight end George Kittle was shocked when the normally tame Purdy hit The Dougie after scampering for a 3-yard touchdown on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns. Purdy extended the Niners lead to 17-8 late in the third quarter with the run en route to a 26-8 victory over Shedeur Sanders and the Browns. He then hit the iconic dance inspired by rap legend Doug E. Fresh, to the amazement of teammate Kittle. Brock Purdy and Kyle Shanahan on the QB’s TD Celebration Purdy said postgame that the dance is his go-to move. “I’ve always been able to Dougie,” he said. “I haven’t really done it publicly. My wife, she can tell you, I annoy her in the kitchen. That’s where I got my practice. I told the team, if we score we’re gonna have some fun and I’m gonna hit The Dougie. I got an (opportunity) to do it, so I did it.” Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed postgame that Purdy was under a lot of pressure to pull off the celebration. “I thought it was pretty good,” Shanahan said. “He told the team he was gonna do that if he scored. So he had pressure on him to do, he couldn’t let them down, so it was nice.” What is The Dougie Dance? The Dougie is a hip hop dance move characterized by swaying the body from side to side while running a hand through, or near, one’s hair. The move originated in Dallas, Texas, taking inspiration-and its name-from similar dance gestures popularized by 1980s rapper Doug E. Fresh. It first gained attention when rapper Lil’ Wil released the 2007 local hit “My Dougie.” Later, a dancer known as C-Smoove in Southern California taught the routine to the group that would become Cali Swag District. The group went on to record “Teach Me How to Dougie” and film its music video in Inglewood, California, during the summer of 2009. The video and the dance subsequently gained widespread popularity. Niners Remain Relevant in Division and Wild Card Purdy added a passing touchdown in the second half to go with his rushing score. San Francisco had trailed 8-7 late in the first half, but ultimately spoiled Sanders’ home debut in Cleveland. All three 49ers touchdowns came on short fields two following recovered turnovers and another set up by a 66-yard punt return from Skyy Moore. Purdy finished 16-of-29 for 168 yards, scoring on a 2-yard keeper in the third quarter before hitting Jauan Jennings for a 7-yard touchdown in the fourth. Christian McCaffrey contributed 74 scrimmage yards (53 rushing, 21 receiving) and a touchdown, with most of his production coming after halftime. For Cleveland (3-9), Sanders went 16-of-25 for 149 yards and a touchdown, and was sacked three times. San Francisco (9-4) remains relevant in the division and wild card races. They currently hold the No. 7 seed behind the Seattle Seahawks (8-3) and Green Bay Packers (8-3-1). The Los Angeles Rams (9-3) are currently leading the NFC West, despite losing to the Carolina Panthers (7-6) on Sunday.",

But avoiding the crowds might mean you miss out on the best deals. Discover More: 5 Sam’s Club Items Under $35 That Smart Seniors Should Stock Up On for Winter Read More: 6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 Although it can’t give you the precise traffic for your specific Wal-Mart location, ChatGPT has some surprisingly accurate suggestions when I asked it for the best times to shop at Wal-Mart. Early Morning Weekdays ChatGPT’s first suggestion was to go right when Walmart opens, around 7 to 9 a. m. on weekdays. Honestly, that’s spot on. During the week, you’ll run into fewer crowds, freshly stocked shelves and more time to wander the aisles and snag the first pick of rollbacks. Although staff may still be setting up displays and stocking shelves, this is generally a far more pleasant experience than shopping at noon on a Saturday. Find Out: 7 Trader Joe’s Dinners That Will Feed Your Entire Family for Under $15 Late Evening After most people finish their post-work Walmart runs, you’ll likely find fewer shoppers scanning the shelves alongside you. However, shopping too close to closing time can come with added pressure to wrap up quickly. You’ll also likely notice that many markdowns have already been picked over and restockers may be blocking off certain aisles. Early in the week After weekend crowds have shopped to their hearts’ content, one of the best times to shop at Walmart, according to ChatGPT, is on a Monday or Tuesday. It pulled this information from an article on Eating Well that discusses this topic and includes expert shoppers’ insights. ChatGPT said, “Stores tend to be more orderly after weekend traffic. Some markdowns hit early in the week.” However, you may miss out on popular items if they sell out over the weekend. Times To Avoid ChatGPT also included times to avoid if you’d prefer not to wade through crowds of Walmart shoppers: Weekday evenings (especially 4-7 p. m.): The after-work rush is grabbing items for dinner or school. Weekend afternoons and midday: Prime time for everyone who couldn’t shop during the week. Right before major holidays or events: Chaos guaranteed. Lunchtime (about 12-2 p. m.): Many people swing by on their lunch break. The first weekend of the month: Benefit payments often increase foot traffic. To customize your shopping to your specific Walmart location, try using these tips to score the best deals without compromising on efficiency. Ask the staff about the schedule for markdowns and busy times. Use store traffic tools and apps to find “peak times.” Check clearance aisles early in the week for extra rollbacks. Bottom Line The best time to shop at Walmart ultimately depends on where you’re shopping and what you’re trying to find. If you’re looking for fewer crowds, you may have to embrace the trade-off of missing out on certain deals. However, going when all the rollbacks hit means you’ll likely encounter more people looking for the same discounts as you. While ChatGPT provides some great suggestions on the best times to shop, you may find that you get more in-depth information from your local Walmart staff, who know the ins and outs of their restocks, markdowns, and busiest times. 7 Best Holiday Gifts for Tech Lovers From Costco 7 Little Luxuries To Buy at Dollar Tree This November 4 Low-Risk Accounts Financially Savvy People Trust for Reliable Returns And How You Can Use Them How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates. com: I Asked ChatGPT for the Best Times To Shop at Walmart: Here’s What It Said The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

A Copa Intercontinental ocupa, no calendário, o período que destinado ao Mundial no formato antigo, que reunia sete clubes (seis campeões continentais e um representante do país-sede), no qual as equipes da América do Sul e da Europa entravam diretamente na semifinal. Desde o ano passado, são apenas seis times, um por confederação. A edição deste ano teve início em setembro, com o embate entre os ganhadores das Ligas dos Campeões da África (Pyramids, do Egito) e da Oceania (Auckland City, da Nova Zelândia). Os egípcios venceram (3 a 0) e se credenciaram à disputa da Copa África-Ásia-Oceania, contra o representante asiático (Al Ahli, da Arábia Saudita). A equipe africana levou novamente a melhor (3 a 1), ergueu o troféu e se garantiu na chamada Copa Challenger, em que terá pela frente o vencedor do duelo entre Flamengo e Cruz Azul, do México, que disputam o Dérbi das Américas em Doha, também valendo taça. O confronto será no dia 10 de dezembro, às 14h (horário de Brasília). Vale lembrar, porém, que a última rodada do Campeonato Brasileiro está marcada para 7 de dezembro, três dias antes do jogo no Catar. Quem passar, enfrenta o Pyramids no dia 13 de dezembro, no mesmo local e horário. O ganhador dessa Copa Challenger, por fim, faz a final da Copa Intercontinental com o Paris Saint-Germain, da França, vencedor da última Liga dos Campeões da Europa. A decisão também será em Doha, no dia 17 de dezembro. Em 2024, o Botafogo foi o representante brasileiro e sul-americano na Intercontinental. O Glorioso foi superado pelo Pachuca, do México, por 3 a 0, pelo Dérbi das Américas. O título ficou com o Real Madrid, da Espanha, que bateu os mexicanos por 3 a 0. O Mundial de Clubes de 2029, por sua vez, ainda não tem sede definida. A América do Sul tem direito a seis vagas, sendo quatro para os campeões da Libertadores do quadriênio 2025-2028, o que significa que o Flamengo já está garantido. O Rubro-Negro esteve na edição deste ano, nos Estados Unidos, e chegou às oitavas de final, sendo eliminado pelo Bayern de Munique, da Alemanha. Também estão com vaga assegurada: Al-Ahli, Cruz Azul, Pyramids e PSG. Leia mais:.",

            "content": "Data analytics and artificial intelligence company Databricks Inc. is reportedly in talks to raise $5 billion in new funding on a $134 billion valuation. The new funding, if it should happen, would come after Databricks previously raised funding on a $100 billion valuation in August. The valuation of the round is roughly 32 times the company’s expected sales of $4. 1 billion next year, according to Reuters and comes at a time when enterprise demand for Databricks’ platform continues to grow as organizations expand their use of generative AI, machine learning and real-time analytics. Founded in 2013, Databricks offers cloud-based data and artificial intelligence software that gives organizations a unified platform for data engineering, analytics and machine learning. The company’s core platform is designed to replace fragmented data stacks with a single environment where data teams can work from raw ingestion through to advanced analytics. Databricks’ “Lakehouse” architecture combines the low-cost storage of data lakes with the performance and management features of traditional data warehouses. The approach allows organizations to store structured and unstructured data in one place while supporting SQL analytics, real-time streaming and large-scale batch processing. Besides analytics, Databricks also offers a platform for enterprise AI and machine learning, with tools that support full lifecycle AI development, including feature engineering, model training, evaluation and deployment. As noted when Databricks previously raised funding in August, the company has been locked in a duel with rival Snowflake Inc. for supremacy in AI development, but unlike Snowflake, has resisted pressure to go public. If it did eventually go public, the offering would be likely well received, as long as the current argued AI-driven boom in equity markets doesn’t bust. While best known for its analytics, Databricks’ topline growth is being driven by organizations expanding their use of generative AI and machine learning. While AI may be the key driver of growth at Databricks, it’s also putting pressure on its margins, with the company reportedly having told investors its gross margin is falling faster than anticipated, to 74% compared to an earlier plan for 77%, due to increasing usage of its AI products. Databricks has more than 20, 000 customers. Notable Databricks customers include OpenAI Group PBC, Block Inc., Shell plc, Siemens AG, Toyota Motor Corp., AT&T Inc., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.. Coming into the potential new funding, Databricks has previously raised approximately $15. 7 billion over 15 rounds, according to data from Tracxn. Investors in the company include Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners LP, MGX Capital, Thrive Capital Management, WCM Investment Management, The Blackstone Group Inc., Apollo Global Management Inc., Blue Owl Capital Inc., J P Morgan Chase & Co., Barclays plc, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley.

            "content": "O presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, confirmou ter conversado por telefone com o ditador da Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, em meio à escalada militar travada pela Casa Branca no mar do Caribe. A confirmação foi dada pelo republicano a jornalistas, neste domingo (30/11), quando ele estava a bordo do avião presidencial, a caminho de Washington após passar o Dia de Ação de Graças na Flórida. A conversa entre Trump e Maduro começou a ser ventilada nos bastidores da diplomacia norte-americana, gerando expectativa sobre a possibilidade do início de uma negociação entre Washington e Caracas. Nos últimos dias, os EUA ordenaram o fechamento do espaço aéreo da Venezuela, o que acendeu alertas sobre um eventual ataque militar ao país. “Eu não quero comentar sobre, mas a resposta é sim”, disse Donald Trump ao se perguntado se a ligação ocorreu. O republicano não deu mais detalhes sobre o diálogo. Segundo o New York Post, Trump teria orientado Maduro a deixar a Venezuela imediatamente para proteger a si mesmo e sua família. O venezuelano, segundo a publicação, teria exigido manutenção do controle militar no país e anistia, em troca de eleições livres. De acordo com a imprensa norte-americana, a tensa conversa ocorreu na semana passada, ou seja, antes da ordem de fechamento do espaço aéreo e, até mesmo, de um avião já utilizado por Maduro pousar numa cidade localizada na fronteira com o Brasil, o que gerou especulações sobre o paradeiro do líder venezuelano. Investida militar Trump chegou a dizer, na última semana, que ataques terrestres a carteis de drogas da Venezuela poderiam ocorrer “muito em breve”. Desde o início da escalada militar, os EUA começaram a explodir embarcações civis no Atlântico e no Pacífico, sob o pretexto de combate ao transporte de drogas. O país enviou, também, o maior porta-aviões do mundo para o Mar do Caribe, o que gerou alerta na região sobre uma possível invasão. O Brasil, considerado uma liderança diplomática da região, observa atentamente a situação. Apesar de o presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) ter rompido relação com Maduro ao não reconhecer a última eleição na Venezuela, o petista recriminaria uma ofensiva militar dos EUA.",

            "content": "Shedeur Sanders sent a clear message to himself after his second-straight start for the Cleveland Browns. Sanders remained the starting quarterback for the Browns, despite Dillon Gabriel being cleared from concussion protocol. In his second start, Sanders didn’t turn the ball over, but he didn’t have much success, either. Following the 26-8 home loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, Sanders shared some criticism he has of himself. “I just gotta be better overall,” Sanders said postgame on Sunday. “I gotta be able to rally everybody together when adversity is hitting.” It’s a clear message from Sanders as he wasn’t happy with his performance, or how the team played either, as he felt like he should have made the offense have more success. Sanders went 16-of-25 for 149 yards and a touchdown in the loss, and was also sacked three times. The Browns’ rookie held onto the ball too long at times, which has been an issue for him dating back to college. Despite his poor performance, Sanders will remain the starting quarterback for the Browns in Week 14 against the Tennessee Titans. Browns Remaining With Sanders at QB Although the Browns suffered a lopsided loss to the 49ers on Sunday, Cleveland will remain with Sanders at quarterback. After the game, Stefanski confirmed that Sanders will remain the starting quarterback in Week 14 when the Browns take on the Tennessee Titans. Yes,” Stefanski said postgame on Sunday when asked if Sanders will remain the starting quarterback. Although Stefanski named Sanders the starter for next week, he wouldn’t confirm if he will remain the starter for the rest of the season. “I’m not going to get into that, other than we all have to get better,” Stefanski added. Stefanski believes there are things Sanders can build on from his second start. But there are also plays he wants back, and he believes Sanders will learn from it. “I’d have to look at it. He’s battling; all our guys are battling. I know there are plays he’d want to have back. We’ll look at it, we will correct it,” Stefanski added. The Browns had just 253 yards of offense against the 49ers. Sanders Puts Jerry Jeudy on Notice After the blowout loss, Sanders also sent a clear message to star receiver Jerry Jeudy. Sanders said he needs to build more trust with Jeudy throughout the week and help get the connection on track. “Overall, it’s about spending time in those situations and being able to gauge,” Sander said. “It was just a missed shot. When I miss that shot, I have to stay on myself to keep shooting. Of course, you want to get him the ball, but you’ve got to understand it takes time. I’m more of a trust person. That’s just what it boils down to.
