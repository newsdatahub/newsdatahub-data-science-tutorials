            "content": "The people of Ukraine continue to face constant danger from almost daily Russian drone attacks. Adding to the death and destruction, Russian Forces have taken thousands of Ukrainian children into captivity. Mykola Kuleba, founder of Save Ukraine, explains that his organization is committed to rescuing all of Ukraine's children who may have been subjected to human trafficking. \"It's horrible,\" Kuleba says. \"Ukraine lost 50 percent of its children's population. It was more than eight million children who live in Ukraine before the first invasion in 2014. But then the full-scale invasion of 2022, we lost almost four million kids. And the biggest issue is that more than a million stayed in Russia captivity.\" Three yeas ago, Danylo \"Danik\" Yatsentyu and friends at a youth recreation camp were taken captive by invading Russian forces. Danik, now 16, tells CBN News the Russians told them horrible stories about Ukraine. \"They don't want to return us back because 'They're Nazis. They will kill us and they will eat us there.' And that's very dangerous. And I believed that propaganda because everybody kept saying that its dangerous to come back to Ukraine.\" The most cruel statement came when Russians told Danik that his mother didn't want him and didn't love him. Back home, Alla, his mother, desperately searched for her missing son. \"I've been doing the impossible. I've been doing everything to just rescue him,\" she said. Alla reached out to Save Ukraine for help. After six months, they helped reunite Alla and Danik. While their ordeal ended, thousands of children remain separated from their families. Alla says Russia can never be trusted. \"From our children, Russia wants to make them their slaves and their soldiers. Russia is not our friend.\" ***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you receive the latest news from a Christian perspective.*** uleba confirms that children taken into Russian captivity are often exposed to propaganda to indoctrinate them and persuade them to stay in Russia. He adds that Save Ukraine acts like an underground railroad to freedom for the children. \"We rescued a lot of kids who've been taken to military camp or military academy, or Russian army, or have been abused. Through our research, we found that one of 15 is sexually abused in occupied territory.\" The plight of the children came to the attention of First Lady Melania Trump. She wrote a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, seeking his help in returning all of the children. At the White House, she stated, \"A child's soul knows no borders, no flags. We must foster a future for our children. Which is rich with potential security and complete with free will. A world where dreams will be realized rather than faded by war.\" Putin responded by providing a team to work with her representative to ensure the safe return of Ukrainian children. So far, only eight children have been returned. However, Save Ukraine welcomes the First Lady's attention to the children. \"She can help to verify the kids and bring them home,\" Kuleba says. \"We believe this, and we really need her. It's a first step, but I only ask her not stop.\" It is difficult to predict what the fate of the Ukrainian children who are still being held in Russian captivity will be. Save Ukraine says it will not stop trying to rescue every child that was taken by Russian forces. They ask Americans to pray for the peace and protection of all Ukrainians, but in particular, the children, who need to be back home with their families.",

            "content": "NEW YORK U. S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has replaced the head of his controversial vaccine advisory committee, federal officials announced Monday. Martin Kulldorff is leaving the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to take a leadership role within the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said. Dr. Kirk Milhoan, who has blamed vaccines for causing cardiovascular disease, will become the new chair. He had been appointed to the committee in September. HHS officials issued a press release praising Kulldorff and his work while leading the panel but did not answer additional questions about the changes. Kulldorff did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. The committee makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee's recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman. Under Kulldorff's leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups. At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called thimerosal be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm. In September, the group recommended new restrictions on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the unprecedented step of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations not even for high-risk populations like seniors instead making it a matter of personal choice. Several doctors’ groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to follow guidance that was previously in place. Kulldorff's departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members. It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines. The committee is scheduled to meet later this week to discuss the pediatric vaccine schedule and hepatitis B shots given to newborns. Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its traditional \"evidence-to-recommendation\" framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote. In his new role, Kulldorff will become chief science officer within the HHS planning and evaluation office. Officials described the office as the department's “in-house think tank.” “I look forward to contributing to the science-based public health policies that will Make America Healthy Again,\" Kulldorff said in the HHS press release. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "content": "Republican strategist Scott Jennings asserted he would be stunned if the Democratic Party did not nominate a socialist for president in 2028 during a Manhattan Institute interview posted on Tuesday. Jennings’ comments in the interview posted to the Manhattan Institute’s YouTube channel followed Democratic Socialist New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s Nov. 4 victory against former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Republican strategist predicted that the passion of the socialist wing of the Democratic Party would be unbeatable. (RELATED: Mamdani-Loving Queer Socialist Primaries Hakeem Jeffries) WATCH: “[T]hat’s where their energy is. It’s obvious. It’ll be shocking to me if they don’t nominate a socialist for president in 2028,” Jennings said. “They fought it off in ’16. They fought it off in ’20. They’re not going to fight it off in 2028.” Manhattan Institute President Reihan Salam told Jennings he believed Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear would win the nomination and be “flanked by socialist advisers.” “I don’t know about that. I think someone has to be able to channel the emotional energy . You have to be able to absorb and reflect the emotional energy of the electorate,” Jennings replied. “That’s what [President Donald] Trump got about the Republicans in ’16 that none of the other 17 got. It’s what Trump got about the country last year. It’s what Mamdani, I guess, got about, you know, enough people here in New York. You have to be able to absorb and reflect the emotional energy of enough people to win.” “And it requires a bit of showmanship. It doesn’t require advisers. It requires a bit of personal talent and showmanship. That’s part of the game now. And so my impression is it’ll be somebody like that,” he added. “It won’t be a milquetoast person going, ‘Well, but I’ve got a whole politburo here that’ll help me.’ It’ll be somebody who can personally understand the energy and reflect it back.” Jennings said it would be difficult for Beshear to compete with a socialist candidate. “He’ll have a hard time, I think, competing with people who are more authentically radical anti-American socialists. But that’s what the Democrats want,” he said. “They want somebody who thinks America’s rotten at the core. They want somebody who thinks capitalism has failed. And they want somebody who’d like to rip all of it out and install some other very un-American ideology. Beshear, I think, would have a hard time keeping up with the emotional energy of that.” Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ran for president as a Democrat in 2016 and 2020. He asserted on “Flagrant” in May that both of his campaigns faced “hatred” from the “Democratic establishment.” “[T]he establishment did not want to open the door. They hated the idea for all these people whose hands were a little bit dirty, who didn’t have PhDs or weren’t wealthy imagine walking in: ‘It’s my party, man. You ain’t getting in. We will fight you in the most ruthless ways that we can.’ And that’s the struggle,” Sanders said. “Are they gonna open the door, or are they prepared to lose elections, literally, and wire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

They're native to Brazil, but are also grown in parts of Asia and Africa, and are closely related to the pistachio. Cashews are often found in snack mixes, or are processed to make products such as cashew milk, cheese, or butter. Pecans are native to North America, grown throughout the United States and Mexico. They're in the same family as walnuts. While you may associate pecans with pie or other desserts, they can also be part of savory dishes. Which Nut Is the Healthier Choice? Cashews and pecans do have different levels of certain nutrients, but these differences are quite small. The best one for you is most likely the one that aligns with your taste preferences. However, if you're most focused on hitting your protein goals, cashews may be a better choice, while pecans could help you maximize unsaturated fats in your diet. There are other health goals that may come into play when you're deciding between cashews and pecans: Vitamin and mineral content: Cashews have slightly higher levels of iron, magnesium, and zinc. These nuts are also one of the top plant sources of copper, which helps the body maintain tissue health and immune system function. Digestive health: Pecans have more fiber, which is essential for healthy digestion. Fiber also helps control blood sugar and cholesterol. Adults should get between 22-34 grams of fiber daily, depending on their age and gender. Heart health and diabetes risk factors: Because of their fat and fiber content, both types of nuts have cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Research has shown that eating cashews is linked to better cholesterol and insulin levels, as well as lower blood pressure, for people with type 2 diabetes. Pecans have been shown to have some beneficial effects on cholesterol levels, while another study found that eating about 1. 5 ounces of pecans daily improved heart disease and diabetes risk factors in people with overweight or obesity. In general, nuts are a good source of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber, and healthy fats. The quantity of nutrients and compounds found in nuts also depends on factors such as ripeness, growing conditions, or processing.",

G. por violar en varias ocasiones a una amiga de su hijo, ambos menores de edad, en lo que constituiría un delito por el que el Ministerio Público ha pedido 10 años de cárcel. Según relata la Fiscalía en su escrito de acusación, los hechos ocurrieron en julio de 2018, cuando a la salida de la escuela de verano el procesado recogía a su hijo y a su amiga y los llevaba a comer a su casa. Como el encausado era conocido de los padres de la víctima y estos salían más tarde de trabajar, era común que la menor pasara las tardes de entre semana con el acusado y su hijo, hasta que su familia la recogía. En al menos cinco ocasiones, el acusado se introdujo en la cama que compartían los dos menores durante la hora de la siesta, creyendo que estos estaban dormidos. Fue entonces cuando aprovechaba para agredir a la niña, quien no decidió denunciar hasta que dos años después vio en el instituto una charla sobre violencia sexual.",

The company will also pay $3. 4 million in civil penalties under the agreement with the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. It also agrees to comply with the city’s Fair Workweek law going forward. A company spokeswoman said Starbucks is committed to operating responsibly and in compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations in every market where it does business, but also noted the complexities of the city’s law. “This (law) is notoriously challenging to manage and this isn’t just Starbucks issue, nearly every retailer in the city faces these roadblocks,” spokeswoman Jaci Anderson said. Most of the affected employees who held hourly positions will receive $50 for each week worked from July 2021 through July 2024, the department said. Workers who experienced a violation after that may be eligible for compensation by filing a complaint with the department. The $38. 9 million settlement also guarantees employees laid off during recent store closings in the city will get the chance for reinstatement at other company locations. The city began investigating in 2022 after receiving dozens of worker complaints against several Starbucks locations, and eventually expanded its investigation to the hundreds of stores in the city. The probe found most Starbucks employees never got regular schedules and the company routinely reduced employees’ hours by more than 15%, making it difficult for staffers to know their regular weekly earnings and plan other commitments, such as child care, education or other jobs. The company also routinely denied workers the chance to pick up extra shifts, leaving them involuntarily in part-time status, according to the city. The agreement with New York comes as Starbucks’ union continues a nationwide strike at dozens of locations that began last month. The number of affected stores and the strike’s impact remain in dispute by the two sides.",

            "content": "Abbott has issued a medical device correction for 3 million continuous glucose monitors, the company announced Nov. 24. Testing revealed that some Freestyle Libre 3 systems may provide incorrect low glucose readings-potentially leading to serious health complications for people with diabetes. Worldwide, there have been 736 reports of severe adverse events (57 in the U. S.) and seven deaths that may be linked to this issue. Which Glucose Sensors Are Affected? The incorrect readings have been associated with FreeStyle Libre 3 and FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus sensors. You can check if your sensor is affected by searching its serial number here. The correction does not impact the FreeStyle Libre 3 reader or app, or any other Libre products. What You Should Do If your FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor is affected, stop using it immediately. Request a free replacement from Abbott, and in the meantime, make treatment decisions using a blood glucose meter, the built-in meter in your FreeStyle Libre 3 Reader, or an unaffected sensor.",

The former Women's World Champion shared the news on Instagram that it is her \"first American Child's\" Birthday. She noted that her dog was celebrating her 8th Birthday today and even shared a photo on her stories. Thanks for the submission! Luna is one of Rhea Ripley's many dogs, since she often shares updates from her animals with Bella and Barry being the ones who she updates the most. Ripley has always been a huge fan of animals and shared many posts about her dogs whilst she was out of action with a shoulder injury last year. Rhea Ripley is married to AEW star Buddy Matthews and the couple has several animals Rhea Ripley is married to fellow Australian wrestler Buddy Matthews, who was known as Buddy Murphy in WWE. The couple has been together for several years and has a number of animals together while they are still touring with their respective wrestling companies. Ripley is expected to be part of tonight's episode of WWE RAW, but she was part of a brutal WarGames match at Survivor Series on Saturday night. Ripley and Charlotte Flair put their differences aside so that they could compete inside the WarGames structure, but it appears that Ripley could have her own problems coming out of the show. Ripley and Iyo Sky were in a feud with The Kabuki Warriors ahead of her injury and now that they have beaten their team at WarGames, they could challenge for the Women's Tag Team Championships. It will be interesting to see what the story for Ripley is coming out of WarGames and heading into the festive season.",

            "creator": "Chelsie Napiza",
            "content": "From a missile blast in the Caribbean to a children's book parody, the controversy surrounding US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken a turn that many deem grotesque. The uproar intensified after Hegseth shared a cartoonish image at a moment when he faces grave accusations of authorising an unlawful second strike against survivors of a boat attack. His post, which portrays a beloved animated turtle launching a missile, landed not as humour but as a provocation, sharpening scrutiny over the legality and morality of the operation in question. Instead of offering transparency or a detailed rebuttal, Hegseth's online provocation has widened the political and legal fallout that raises fresh concerns about the judgement of the official at the centre of a rapidly escalating scandal. Mockery Amid Massacre On 1 December 2025, Hegseth posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account a doctored cover of the beloved children's book character Franklin the Turtle, re-titled 'Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists', depicting the turtle firing a missile from a helicopter at a boat. The caption, 'For your Christmas wish list.'. The post came just days after a damning report by The Washington Post alleged that, on 2 September 2025, Hegseth personally ordered a US strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel off the Caribbean coast, and then instructed the elimination of any survivors. According to two US officials with direct knowledge, the command wasm 'kill everybody'. When two men survived the initial blast, the Special Operations commander overseeing the assault allegedly authorised a second 'double-tap' strike, killing the survivors, to comply with Hegseth's order. Legal Alarm Bells: War Crime or Murder? International law experts and former military lawyers have warned that the alleged double-tap strike, followed by Hegseth's mocking post, may constitute a war crime or outright murder. In a public statement, the group known as the Former JAGs Working Group said that orders to 'give no quarter' and kill survivors, especially those already shipwrecked or otherwise incapacitated, violate both US military law and the laws of armed conflict. As the statement reads, 'Whether one calls it war crime, or murder, or both there are no other options'. Senators from both parties have publicly condemned the reported order. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told ABC's This Week he believed 'it's very possible there was a war crime committed'. Simultaneously, congressional oversight committees, led by the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, announced they will conduct a full review of the strike, demanding all orders, legal justifications, and video evidence from the Pentagon. Defence, Denials and a Meme In the wake of the revelations, Hegseth defended the strikes as legitimate operations against 'narco-terrorists', claiming they were 'lawful under both US and international law' and approved by 'the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command'. Yet the decision to use a children's character, previously associated with innocence and education, to depict a lethal strike against human beings has drawn sharp condemnation for being gratuitously provocative and morally irresponsible. Critics argue it shows utter disregard for human life. Since September 2025, the US military has conducted more than 20 air strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, killing at least 80 people, under the banner of Operation Southern Spear. The Trump administration justifies the campaign by designating drug traffickers as 'narco-terrorists'. but critics argue the United States has blurred the line between law enforcement and military action and in doing so, undermined legal norms that once formed the backbone of rule-of-law enforcement against crime. So far, the US government has released almost no public evidence, no names of victims; no cargo manifests; no legal memos; no video feeds; and almost no transparency. The families of those killed remain largely unidentified, afraid, or unable to come forward. And now, with the Franklin parody, their deaths are being treated as a punchline. The mocking cartoon adds insult to injury, converting what may be mass killing into a propaganda meme, distancing decision-makers from the human consequences of their actions.",

            "content": "President Trump never fails to school reporters in classic Trumpian fashion when they ask gotcha and naughty questions in an effort to humiliate him. Last night was no exception. As The Gateway Pundit reported, Trump underwent an MRI during his recent medical check-up at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. According to him, everything went perfectly. During an Air Force One press gaggle on Sunday evening, one female reporter demanded to know when the public could expect him to release his MRI results. Trump replied that he would be happy to do so. Unsatisfied, the woman then became extremely nosy, asking what part of the body the MRI had examined. What was she trying to get at? Trump responded to the query with a classically funny reply. He refused to play her game, just noting that the MRI did not focus on the brain because he had already aced a cognitive test before frying the reporter’s lower IQ. He then said ‘goodbye’ and shut down any further questions. WATCH: TRUMP: If you want me to release it, I’ll release it. REPORTER: What part of the body was the MRI looking at? TRUMP: I have no idea, it was just an MRI. It wasn’t on the brain, because I took a cognitive test and I aced it. I got a perfect mark. Which you would be incapable of doing. And you too! Goodbye, everybody! While reporters hound Trump over his health and push a narrative that it is in decline, they completely ignored a total vegetable in the White House for four years. Because of this, one could say Trump’s response was a bit too kind.",

            "content": "A Russian Soyuz launch mishap late last week left the country without a manned space program until vital launch infrastructure can be replaced or repaired. While Americans were celebrating Thanksgiving, an unexplained \"accident occurred on the launch pad at Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome,\" according to a NASA Spaceflight report on Sunday, sending the site's mobile maintenance cabin flying and \"lying upside down in the flame trench.\" Site 31/6 is currently Russia's only site rated for manned and cargo launches to the International Space Station (ISS). The good news is that the launch itself was a success, and cosmonauts Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikayev, along with NASA astronaut Christopher Williams, all arrived at the ISS hours later, safely and according to plan. Whew but that's where the good news ends. The bad news is that this might be it for Russia's Soyuz launches for a while, and the ISS still depends on Russia doing its share of the heavy lifting. \"Photos of the accident showed significant damage to the maintenance cabin, which, according to experts, is too extensive to allow for repairs,\" NSF. \"The only way to resume launches from Site 31/6 is to install a spare maintenance cabin or construct a new one.\" This isn't some pre-fab shed. It's a 63-foot by 56-foot beast weighing144 tons, where ground crews conduct \"all pre-launch operations with the lower part of the rocket, including removing protective covers and installing pyrotechnic devices (the famous 'matches') on the rocket engines.\" Tight-lipped as ever, Moscow hasn't said who screwed up or what went wrong. Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, claims to have all the spare parts it needs, but did not say how long repairs or replacement might take or how much it might cost the agency that's already facing severe economic difficulties. Earlier this year, RSC Energia CEO Igor Maltsev who runs Roscosmos’s primary spacecraft contractor described his company's financial condition as \"critical.\" Four weeks ago, Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome had its power cut off for failure to pay its electricity bills. Roscosmos can't afford to pay its contractors, and the ripple effects are felt throughout the country's once-fabled space program. Ars Technica's senior space editor Eric Berger said the launch damage will \"test the current leaders of Russia\" over \"how committed are they to the International Space Station partnership with NASA.\" Before last week, \"they were willing to play out the string to 2030 and the end of the station’s lifetime, but that required minimal investment in new capabilities.\" Berger also pointed out that Russia had already cut its crewed ISS missions by 25%, from four every two years to just three, to save money. \"Now they must devote significant resources to the Soyuz program critical to the ISS,\" Jeff Manber, a senior space exec with years of expertise with Russia’s space program, told Berger, \"We are going to learn just how important the ISS is to leadership there.\" Left unsaid is whether sanctions, labor shortages, and fiscal constraints might mean delays or cancellations, even if Moscow and Roscosmos remain fully committed to their ISS obligations. Unless Moscow suddenly decides to become more forthcoming than usual, we might never know for sure what actually happened at Site 31/6 last week, so there's little sense in speculating any further on that aspect of the story. We need to ask who or what will keep ISS in orbit until 2030. The space station needs a boost every month or two to maintain orbit, which is usually provided by Russia's Progress cargo supply ship. Backup systems include Northrup's Cygnus and the SpaceX Dragon, \"but long-term it is not immediately clear whether US vehicles could completely make up for the loss of Progress vehicles,\" according to Berger. So in this case, Moscow's little rocket problem is everybody's problem. But that wasn't the only rocket fail from last week. The next one is on video and it is spectacular: The rocket is believed to be either an older RS-18/UR-100N ICBM (NATO reporting name SS-19 Stiletto) on a \"glory trip\" operational test launch, or one of Russia's troubled RS-28 Sarmat ICBMs. The Sarmat is supposed to evade all known missile defenses, although flying it directly into the ground after launch is certainly a novel approach. Whatever that missile was, it's interesting that it either wasn't remotely destroyed or didn't self-destruct during the failed launch. The Kremlin remains tight-lipped on this one too, even with a couple of embarrassing videos circulating on social media.",

            "content": "The best snacks for reducing inflammation include apple slices with nut butter, hummus and veggies, and roasted chickpeas. These foods are rich in antioxidants, healthy fats, and nutrients that help lower inflammation and support good health. 1. Apple Slices With Peanut Butter Apples are packed with fiber and antioxidants. Fiber supports a healthy gut microbiome, which helps lower inflammation in the body. Antioxidants are plant compounds that help protect your cells by neutralizing free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can cause inflammation and cell damage. Dip sliced apples in peanut butter for a boost of protein, healthy fats, magnesium, and vitamin E, all nutrients with anti-inflammatory properties. 2. Hummus and Veggies Hummus, made from chickpeas, is a plant-based source of protein. It also contains fiber and antioxidants. Pair it with colorful vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, and cucumbers to add fiber and a variety of healthy plant compounds. 3. Roasted Chickpeas Crispy roasted chickpeas offer a fiber- and protein-rich alternative to chips. They’re also high in protective antioxidants. Season with spices like turmeric and ginger, which have been shown to help reduce inflammation. Add a pinch of black pepper to boost turmeric absorption. To make roasted chickpeas at home, drain and rinse canned chickpeas and toss with olive oil and spices. Roast at 400°F until golden and crunchy. Store in an airtight container for an easy grab-and-go snack. 4. Trail Mix With Dark Chocolate Trail mix made with nuts, seeds, and a few pieces of dark chocolate offers a satisfying blend of healthy fats, antioxidants, and fiber. Include walnuts for a boost of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats. Choose dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa to get the most antioxidant benefits. For an even healthier option, make your own mix with unsweetened dried fruit and lightly salted nuts to keep added sugar and sodium in check. 5. Tuna Salad and Wheat Crackers Tuna salad is a simple, protein-packed snack that supports heart and brain health. To keep it anti-inflammatory, choose tuna packed in water or olive oil and mix it with Greek yogurt or mashed avocado instead of mayonnaise. For extra flavor and antioxidants, stir in chopped celery, red onion, or fresh herbs like dill or parsley. Serve your tuna salad with whole-grain crackers for added fiber and crunch. The mix of protein, healthy fats, and carbs helps maintain steady energy and prevent an afternoon slump. 6. Avocado Toast Avocados are rich in healthy fats and antioxidants like vitamin E and carotenoids. Spread mashed avocado on whole-grain or seeded bread for a balanced snack that provides fiber, complex carbs, and healthy fats. Add sliced tomato, chili flakes, or a drizzle of olive oil for extra flavor and nutrients. To help you stay fuller for longer, top it with hemp seeds or a poached egg. 7. Guacamole With Sliced Veggies Guacamole delivers the same nutrients found in avocado but in a dip-friendly form. Ingredients in guacamole, like olive oil, lime juice, and garlic, add even more nutrients that calm inflammation. Pair it with veggie sticks like bell peppers, celery, or jicama for a satisfying crunch. 8. Yogurt With Nuts and Berries This snack offers a mix of probiotics, antioxidants, and healthy fats. Yogurt provides live cultures that support gut health, while nuts supply healthy fats for satiety. Berries add anthocyanins, which are plant pigments that help neutralize inflammation-causing free radicals. Choose unsweetened Greek yogurt for extra protein and fewer added sugars, as too much sugar can worsen inflammation. 9. Kale Chips Kale is a nutritional powerhouse, loaded with vitamins A and C and other powerful antioxidants. It's also a natural source of lutein, an antioxidant that keeps your eyes healthy. Research suggests that compounds in kale may help protect against inflammation and support gut health. To make kale chips, tear washed kale leaves into pieces, toss them with olive oil and a pinch of salt. Bake at 350°F until crispy. For extra flavor, sprinkle with garlic powder, smoked paprika, or nutritional yeast before baking. 10. No-Bake Energy Bites No-bake energy bites combine rolled oats, chia seeds, and nut butter for a balanced mix of fiber, protein, and healthy fats. They’re quick to make, easy to store, and perfect for busy days. Add mix-ins such as honey, turmeric, dates, or cocoa powder for extra flavor and health benefits. To make no-bake energy bites, stir ingredients together and roll into small balls. Refrigerate until firm for a convenient, grab-and-go snack. 11. Green Smoothie A green smoothie made with leafy greens like spinach and kale, frozen fruit, and chia seeds is the ideal anti-inflammatory snack. While more research is needed, studies suggest that eating chia seeds regularly may help lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation in the body. You can also add a drizzle of honey or a pinch of turmeric or ginger for extra anti-inflammatory benefits. Preparation Tips There are plenty of simple ways to prep anti-inflammatory snacks, so you always have something nourishing on hand. Here are a few ideas:.",

            "content": "They say money makes the world go around, so it’s important you know how to make money in The Forge. I’ll go through some of the best money farming methods available, so you can get rich in no time while playing The Forge. A quick tip is that higher rarity weapons and armor sell for more, so make sure you find out what The Forge Best Armor Recipes and The Forge Best Weapon Recipes are. How to Make Money in The Forge If you plan on playing for a long time and grinding, I suggest using a luck potion. You can purchase this for 350 Gold, and it boosts your luck by 20% for 300 seconds. There is also the luck totem, which increases luck for 5 minutes by 50%. Luck is important, as it means you have a higher chance of obtaining rarer ore when mining. When forging and using rarer ores, you are more likely to craft higher-rarity weapons and armor. These are better, but they also sell for tons more. Eye Ore Speaking of ores, using Eye Ore when forging is a must if you want to forge something that is worth a ton of money. When you are forging and adding ores, you can see the chances of crafting a specific piece of armor or weapon. Using Eye Ore will increase how much the item is worth, allowing you to sell it for a huge profit. You can mine for Eye Ore in the Forgotten Kingdom from Basalt Rock and Basalt Core. As it is so rare to find, make sure you use the luck potion or totem before mining to increase your chances of mining this. Basalt Mining Basalt Rocks and Cores is another great way to earn money. Use the luck potion or totem, have a good pickaxe, then repeatedly mine these. Inside these are multiple high-rarity ores, which you can use to forge weapons and armor that are worth tons of Gold. Goblin Race The Goblin Race is a rare race, and you have a 10. 5% chance of rolling it. Aside from nifty boosts in speed, you also get the Bargain ability. This provides a 12% discount when shopping. Although it doesn’t make you money, it does save you money, so it’s worth a mention!.",

            "content": "Atomkraft, auf Wiedersehen? Mit Doel 2 ist am 30. November 2025 das letzte belgische Atomkraftwerk der ersten Generation vom Netz gegangen. Gleichzeitig plant Frankreich sechs neue Reaktoren, Polen will 2028 mit dem Bau seines ersten AKW beginnen. Grund genug für einen Überblick: Wie geht es in Belgien weiter, welche AKW sollen in Europa noch abgeschaltet werden, und wo kommen neue hinzu? Welche Atomkraftwerke hat Belgien abgeschaltet? Belgien hat 2025 gleich drei Reaktoren stillgelegt. Den Anfang machte im Februar Doel 1, im Oktober folgte Tihange 1. Am 30. November ging Doel 2 vom Netz, ein Zwillingsreaktor des im Februar gestoppten Doel 1. Alle drei Reaktoren erreichten rund 50 Jahre Betriebszeit. Sie gehörten damit zur allerersten Generation belgischer Kernkraftwerke. Übrig bleiben nur noch Doel 4 und Tihange 3 mit einer Gesamtleistung von etwa 2, 2 GW. Beide sollen bis 2035 weiterlaufen. Für die Laufzeitverlängerung haben der belgische Staat und Betreiber Engie ein Joint Venture gegründet: Der Staat übernimmt den Atommüll gegen eine Zahlung von 15 Mrd. €. Wie viele Reaktoren gehen in Europa bis 2030 vom Netz? Seit der Fukushima-Katastrophe im Jahr 2011 sind in der Europäischen Union, in Großbritannien und in der Schweiz bis Ende 2024 insgesamt 37 AKWs stillgelegt worden. Nach einer Auswertung des IWR (Internationales Wirtschaftsforum Regenerative Energien) auf Basis von IAEA-Daten dürfte die Zahl der stillgelegten Reaktoren bis Ende 2030 auf 52 Steigen. Gesamtleistung: Rund 43 GW. Im gleichen Zeitraum sollen höchstens sechs neue Reaktorblöcke mit insgesamt etwa 7, 3 GW ans Netz gehen. Unterm Strich wird Europa im Jahr 2030 also rund 36 GW weniger Atomkraft betreiben als 2011. Ein Hauptgrund für die Stilllegungswelle: das Alter der Anlagen. Von den 114 Atomkraftwerken in Europa ist etwa die Hälfte bereits 40 Jahre und älter. Ihre ursprünglich geplante Betriebsdauer von 30 Jahren haben sie damit schon lange überschritten. Welche Länder legen AKW still? Das Länder-Ranking der AKW-Stilllegungen führt Großbritannien an, wie die IWR-Analyse zeigt. Demnach trennt sich das Vereinigte Königreich bis 2030 von insgesamt 18 Reaktoren. Dahinter folgen Deutschland (17), Spanien (5), Belgien (5), Schweden (4), Frankreich (2) und die Schweiz (1). Der Trend geht also zur Abschaltung. Für IWR-Chef Norbert Allnoch ist daher klar: „Die Vorstellung einer raschen Renaissance der Atomenergie in Europa ist unrealistisch.“ Die „wachsende Atomlücke“ in der Stromversorgung könne nur durch einen „schnellen und massiven Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien“ geschlossen werden. Wo entstehen neue AKW? Trotzdem setzen mehrere Länder weiterhin auf den AKW-Neubau: Frankreich plant sechs EPR-2-Reaktoren an den bestehenden Standorten Penly, Gravelines und Bugey. Allerdings verzögert sich das Programm: Der erste neue Reaktor wird wohl frühestens 2038 ans Netz gehen. Die endgültige Investitionsentscheidung soll EDF nach Gesprächen mit der EU 2026 treffen. Polen will 2028 mit dem Bau seines ersten Kernkraftwerks beginnen. An der Ostseeküste nahe Danzig sollen drei Reaktoren des Typs AP1000 von Westinghouse und Bechtel entstehen. Der kommerzielle Betrieb ist für 2036 geplant die Kosten schätzen Experten auf bis zu 47 Mrd. €. Großbritannien baut in Hinkley Point C zwei EPR-Reaktoren mit einer Gesamtleistung von 3, 2 GW. Das Projekt sollte ursprünglich Mitte der 2020er fertig sein, aktuell wird 2030 angepeilt. Die Niederlande planen laut Koalitionsvertrag zwei neue Kernkraftwerke. Die Regierung stellt dafür 5 Mrd. € bereit. Was kosten die Neubauprojekte? Europas AKW-Neubauten haben eines gemeinsam: Sie dauern länger und kosten mehr als geplant. Das zeigen Daten der Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) und Angaben der Betreiber. Einige Beispiele unterstreichen das: Die hohen Kosten erfordern staatliche Absicherung. Eine von Greenpeace beauftragte Analyse kommt zu dem Schluss: Neue AKW finden nur dann Investoren, wenn der Staat einen Großteil der Risiken übernimmt. Welche Rolle spielen kleine modulare Reaktoren? Neben Großkraftwerken rücken Small Modular Reactors (SMR) zunehmend in den Fokus. Polen will in Włocławek Europas ersten SMR vom Typ BWRX-300 errichten. Geplanter Baubeginn: 2028. Großbritannien plant in Wylfa (Nordwales) bis zu acht Rolls-Royce-Module mit je 470 MW Leistung; Strom soll ab Mitte der 2030er fließen. Allerdings: Weltweit speist noch kein einziges SMR-Projekt Strom ins Netz. Das US-Vorzeigeprojekt NuScale wurde 2023 gestoppt, nachdem die Kosten von 5, 3 auf 9, 3 Mrd. US-Dollar angestiegen waren. Energieökonomin Claudia Kemfert vom Deutschen Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) dämpfte angesichts dessen noch im Januar die Erwartungen: Auch sogenannte Small Modular Reactor (SMR) sind keine Lösung, da sie ebenfalls hohe Kosten, Risiken und Bauzeiten aufweisen würden. Die bisherigen Erfahrungen zeigen, dass sie kaum zu realisieren sind, es gibt keine technologischen Durchbrüche, die dies erwarten ließen. Es müssten tausende SMR gebaut werden, um die notwendigen Bedarfe zu decken, das ist im höchsten Maße unrealistisch, teuer und risikoreich. Kommt die Atomkraft-Renaissance? Belgien steigt aus, Polen und Frankreich investieren Milliarden. Doch führt das zu einer Trendwende? Die Internationale Energieagentur (IEA) erwartet ein globales Comeback der Atomkraft. Claudia Kemfert widerspricht: „Die angeblichen Comeback-Indikatoren der IEA sind nicht durch Fakten gedeckt.“ Ihre Rechnung: Bis 2040 gehen weltweit rund 200 Atomkraftwerke vom Netz. Dem stehen lediglich 53 laufende Neubauprojekte gegenüber, fast alle davon in China. In Europa verzögern sich Projekte regelmäßig um mehr als zehn Jahre, die Kosten übersteigen die Planungen oft um ein Vielfaches. Ihr Fazit: „Atomenergie ist enorm teuer, risikoreich und löst den Bedarf an zusätzlichem Strom nicht.“ Die Milliarden fließen trotzdem. Ob sie sich auszahlen, steht auf einem anderen Blatt. Denn während die Atomkapazität schrumpft, befinden sich in Europa über 600 GW an Wind- und Solarkraftwerken im Bau oder in Planung. Das ist mehr als das Vierzehnfache der nuklearen Pipeline.",

            "content": "Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said his state “attracts criminals” when asked Sunday about rampant welfare fraud linked to Somali residents. Walz deflected blame for more than $1 billion in taxpayer funds stolen through various state programs in a Sunday interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker, instead taking credit for prosecutions of the crimes. Walz also said that people should not “demonize” Minnesota’s Somali population, which is disproportionately represented in the federal fraud cases, according to multiple reports. (RELATED: Blue State Somalis Allegedly Sent Welfare Money To Al-Qaeda Ally Planning Another 9/11) Welker asked the failed 2024 vice presidential candidate if he takes responsibility for allowing taxpayer funds to be looted on such a large scale. “Well, certainly, I take responsibility for putting people in jail,” Walz said. “Governors don’t get to just talk theoretically. We have to solve problems.” “I will note, it’s not just Somalis. Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state,” the governor said. “We’re AAA-bond rated. But that attracts criminals.” President Donald Trump heaped criticism on Walz for the Somali fraud crisis in a Thursday Truth Social post, calling him a “seriously retarded Governor” who “does nothing.” Trump also announced Friday that he is ending a federal designation for Somalis that partially shields them from deportation. Some of the stolen money went to Somali terrorist organization Al-Shabaab, City Journal reported, citing counterterrorism sources. The Islamic group is tied to Al Qaeda, killed several Americans and plotted a 9/11-style plane attack on the U. S. that federal authorities thwarted, leading to the conviction of an Al-Shabaab operative in November 2024. “Those people are going to jail,” Walz said Sunday about those arrested in fraud cases. “We’re doing everything we can. But to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few? It’s lazy.” A coalition of Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) employees said Walz “is 100% responsible for massive fraud” in the state in a Saturday statement, the Daily Caller previously reported. The statement alleged that the governor “systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, repression, and did his best to discredit fraud reports.” All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

            "content": "OAN Staff Blake Wolf 9: 14 AM Monday, December 1, 2025 President Donald Trump is reportedly set to meet with top national security officials in the Oval Office on Monday evening to map out the next course of action on Venezuela. The meeting will reportedly include War Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and chief of staff Susie Wiles, according to a CNN report, citing sources familiar with the matter. The report of the critical meeting on potential Venezuelan military intervention follows President Donald Trump’s Truth Social post on Saturday, announcing that the airspace “above and surrounding Venezuela” should be considered “closed in its entirety.” The Trump administration has continued sending military assets to the Caribbean, indicating a readiness for potential military conflict with Venezuela to confront the Nicolas Maduro regime, which the administration has accused of engaging in drug trafficking alongside international drug cartels. On Sunday, President Trump confirmed he spoke with Maduro over the phone last month, stating, “I don’t want to comment on it. The answer is yes,” when asked by reporters whether he had spoken with the Venezuelan leader. President Trump was asked to disclose details of the conversation, which he declined, adding, “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly. It was a phone call.” According to a report by the Miami Herald, during his phone call with Maduro, President Trump reportedly offered an ultimatum, calling on Maduro to step down and receive safe passage out of the country, but “only if he agreed to resign right away.” “You can save yourself and those closest to you, but you must leave the country now,” Trump reportedly told Maduro. According to the report, Maduro refused to step down immediately and instead asked for worldwide immunity from prosecution while asking to remain in control of the armed forces in exchange for giving up political power. The president also told reporters over the weekend, “Don’t read anything into it,” when asked whether his announcement of the closure of Venezuelan airspace means that the U. S. is considering imminent airstrikes. President Trump went on to explain that the airspace over Venezuela should be closed “because we consider Venezuela to be not a very friendly country.” “They sent millions of people, really, and probably a number in excess of that and a lot of those people shouldn’t be in our country from jails, from gangs, drug dealers, from all of the people that came into our country, shouldn’t have been in our country causing a lot of problems and drugs,” Trump added.

            "content": "Several anonymous sources have praised the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for axing its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, according to a recent report. One such anonymous source said that before FBI Director Kash Patel assumed his position, there was an “over-emphasis” on DEI in the agency, “to the exclusion of actual work,” according to the report from a national alliance of active-duty and retired FBI special agents and analysts, which is set to be handed over to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees this week. The report, cited by the New York Post on Sunday, comes as the Trump administration has been cracking down on DEI-related efforts across corporate America as well as various federal agencies. (RELATED: Scott Jennings Delivers Sharp Retort When Asked About FBI Investigating Dems Who Told Military To Ignore Trump) Additionally, another anonymous source cited in the report said that “younger FBI employees enjoyed programs focused on DEI because those programs took their time away from doing actual work,” while “the more senior [FBI] employees stayed silent for fear of being labeled a ‘racist’ when it came to commenting on the focus placed on DEI.” The same source claimed that the FBI eliminating DEI-related programs and training has helped to lessen the “administrative burden” placed on employees at the agency, the report states. The FBI did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. A third anonymous source asserted that “FBI Special Agents and other FBI personnel spend too much time on administrative work, but .. [the source] did note the administrative burden has improved since the removal of time required to spend on DEI,” per the report. Moreover, a separate anonymous source cited in the report said that the core “mission” at the FBI is “refocusing on ‘Do your f’ing job’ rather than on non-mission essential or counter-productive tasks, or sensitivity training,” which the same source claimed was “insulting to the majority of [FBI] employees who do not need to be told how to communicate.” There have been various reports that the Biden administration led a massive push to embed DEI initiatives across a variety of federal agencies. The FBI announced in January that it had closed its DEI office in December 2024, Fox News first reported. President Donald Trump wrote in a Jan. 20 executive order aiming to axe “radical and wasteful” DEI programs across the federal government that Americans “deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great.” All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

            "content": "NBC Sunday Night Football analyst Rodney Harrison appeared to freeze on camera when asked about the Washington Commanders’ defense, prompting viewers to worry about his health. NBC analyst Jac Collinsworth asked Harrison how the Denver Broncos should attack Washington’s defense. Harrison began by saying, “Yeah, I look at.” before lapsing into mumbles. “I forgot the. I’m sorry,” Harrison said. Collinsoworth then repeated the question. “The best way to attack them . I’m sorry. There’s a lot of stuff going on, I’m sorry. They don’t have a lot of discipline on the defensive side of the ball. That’s it. I’m sorry, guys.” X users quickly relayed their concerns for Harrison’s health. “Rodney mentioned that ‘there is a lot going on. Then he kept looking down at papers on the desk in front of him. Maybe he has some life challenges right now. Wishing the best for him,” one user wrote. “Clearly issues related to his hard-hitting days as a player, wrote another. “Sad.” “Something not right with Rodney Harrison tonight,” one person wrote. “Someone should check on that man,” another added. There is also the chance that Harrison heard a lot of chatter in his earpiece from his producers and didn’t hear or understand Collinsworth’s question. Hopefully, that was it.",

Government agencies and businesses in the national capital were asked to reduce staffing and allow employees to work from home, while schools across the city were closed. Restrictions have been placed on trucks and automobiles within Tehran to reduce emissions. This had the unusual side effect of filling the streets with women riding on motorbikes, because it was impossible for men to drive them around in cars, as normally required by Iran’s repressive Islamist cultural regulations. A deputy for Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian admitted that “air pollution will kill if it becomes any more than this.” The director of emergency services for Tehran said on Monday that least 357 people died from causes related to air pollution over the past eight days. The director said his agency fielded thousands of emergency calls from people who found it difficult to cope with the toxic atmosphere. On Sunday, Tehran reported one of the worst air quality levels in the world, surpassing even the notoriously unhealthy Indian capital of New Delhi. Several other Iranian cities have reported “orange” air quality alerts, meaning their atmosphere is considered unhealthy for children, the elderly, and people with respiratory conditions.",

El mensaje, realizado siempre al margen de Zarzuela, sale a la luz dos días antes de la publicación en España de sus controvertidas memorias, Reconciliación. Generalmente, desde la Casa de S. M. el Rey no comentan nada relacionado con los asuntos de Juan Carlos I, dado que siempre argumentan que corresponde a su actividad privada. Hay que recordar que fue el propio Juan Carlos I quien comunicó a Felipe VI en 2019 su decisión de retirarse de la vida pública e institucional. Por ese motivo, esta reacción es excepcional, ya que tampoco han entrado a valorar otras polémicas como la publicación de sus memorias o la entrevista concedida a France 3 y que le realizó el periodista Stéphane Bern. Tal y como aseguran desde la Casa del Rey, desconocían la existencia de este vídeo, no habían sido informados del mismo, no entienden la conveniencia del mismo y lo tachan de \"inoportuno e innecesario\". Un mensaje que tiene como fondo una bandera de España, y que es el primer mensaje que dirige Juan Carlos I a los españoles desde el anuncio de su abdicación en 2014.",

FAQs When is Cyber Monday? Cyber Monday starts on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. Deals often roll over from Black Friday weekend and last through the rest of the week. Does Costco have a Cyber Monday sale? Yes. Costco will begin Cyber Monday deals online starting Dec. 1. Are tech products really cheaper during Cyber Monday? Yes -- we often see some of the lowest prices of the year on a variety of tech products during Cyber Monday sales including TVs, laptops, headphones, and more. How did we choose these Cyber Monday deals? ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.

            "content": "The Splinter Cell remake Ubisoft announced in 2021 has a new director: His name is David Grivel, and if that rings a bell it might be because he was director on the project when it was first announced, but split-from the game and Ubisoft entirely-just under a year later. Grivel said when he left Ubisoft in October 2022 that after 11 years at the company, \"it is now time for me to go on a new adventure.\" That adventure, according to his LinkedIn profile, took him immediately to Electronic Arts, where he spent a year and a half working on Battlefield 6 as studio design director at Ridgeline Games. That came to an end when Ridgeline closed in early 2024 as part of major cuts at EA, and so Grivel tripped back to Ubisoft to work briefly on \"an unannounced project in conception phase.\" He left again at the end of 2024 to join Worlds Untold-just in time for that studio to fall victim to major cuts at NetEase. And now he's back where it all began. \"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake! \"A very special team and project to me.\" If you're hoping that Grivel followed that up with big news about the state of the Splinter Cell remake, sorry, but no-that's the whole thing, start to finish. Which, wildly, means that Grivel's return announcement is the first bit of news we've had about the game since his departure announcement three years ago. There was (faint) hope for some sort of new info earlier this year, but that went nowhere, and as if that wasn't bad enough, Ubisoft continued its decade-long run of trolling Splinter Cell fans with an image of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, except it was actually a pic of Sam in Pandora Tomorrow. As trolls go, that was a good one.",

La iniciativa llega tras la decisión de la Comisión Internacional para la Conservación del Atún Atlántico (ICCAT), que ha autorizado un incremento del 17% en las capturas para los próximos años. Desde el Partido Popular de Conil han mostrado su satisfacción por el resultado obtenido. Su presidente, Antonio Aragón, ha subrayado que el respaldo del Pleno supone “un paso imprescindible para ofrecer una solución real a los problemas que está sufriendo la flota pesquera artesanal de Conil”. Aragón recordó que los pescadores y pescadoras del municipio afrontan actualmente “la afección del alga asiática invasora, la caída de las ventas, la pérdida de sus caladeros tradicionales, el desplazamiento de especies esenciales y los efectos del cambio climático”. A su juicio, la concesión de cuota de atún rojo a cada embarcación “sería un importante balón de oxígeno para un sector que, lamentablemente, está en decadencia”. El presidente popular insistió además en que la inclusión de la flota artesanal en el reparto supondría “dar futuro al sector”, al tiempo que permitiría “favorecer un relevo generacional que ahora mismo no existe porque los jóvenes no ven en el mar una oportunidad de futuro”.",

            "content": "From Hollywood power couples to long-term marriages, 2025 has delivered one shocking celebrity split after another. Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom ended their nine-year relationship in June. Jessica Alba filed for divorce from Cash Warren after 16 years of marriage. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban called time on their nearly two-decade marriage. The sheer volume of breakups has left fans wondering whether fame itself makes lasting love nearly impossible. Why Celebrity Marriages Face Higher Divorce Rates Research from the UK-based Marriage Foundation offers striking data: celebrity couples divorce at roughly double the rate of the general population. A study of 488 famous couples married between 2001 and 2010 found that 50 per cent had split within 14 years, compared to 26 per cent among ordinary UK couples. Musicians fare worst, with divorce rates reaching 60 per cent. The reasons are surprisingly predictable. Demanding work schedules keep couples apart for months. Media scrutiny turns private disagreements into public spectacles. Financial independence removes one of the barriers that might otherwise keep unhappy couples together. As the Marriage Foundation's research director, Harry Benson, noted, wealth usually cushions people from stressors that lead to breakups, yet celebrities experience the opposite effect. 2025's Notable Splits: A Running List Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom confirmed their separation in July after nearly a decade together and one daughter, Daisy Dove. Sources told People that the couple had been struggling with the same issues for years, including communication breakdowns caused by conflicting schedules. Perry has since been linked to former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Jessica Alba and Cash Warren filed for divorce in February, ending a 16-year marriage. According to ABC News, both cited irreconcilable differences. Alba has since begun dating actor Danny Ramirez. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban separated over the summer, with Kidman filing for divorce in September. Court documents obtained by CBS News show they share custody of their two daughters, with Kidman serving as primary residential parent. Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas ended their nine-month relationship in October, with sources telling The Sun that the 'spark had gone' but they remain friends and plan to continue working together. Tim Burton and Monica Bellucci announced their split in September after two years of dating, issuing a joint statement expressing 'much respect and deep care for each other'. Nina Dobrev and Shaun White called off their engagement in September after five years together. Sources told People the decision was mutual, though reports suggest differing views on starting a family may have played a role. Is This Really More Breakups, Or Just More Coverage? Some experts caution against declaring 2025 a record year for splits. The Marriage Foundation's data suggests celebrity relationships have always been precarious. What may have changed is visibility. Social media amplifies every development, turning routine breakups into headline news within hours. Yet cultural shifts likely play a role too. Many 2025 splits cite 'irreconcilable differences' or 'growing apart' rather than scandal or infidelity. This reflects a broader societal trend towards prioritising personal fulfilment and mental health over staying in unfulfilling partnerships. As Kidman told Harper's Bazaar amid her separation, painful experiences can ultimately lead to growth if approached 'gently and slowly'. Fame, it seems, offers no protection from the ordinary challenges of love. If anything, it amplifies them. What This Means Beyond the Headlines The swirl of celebrity split announcements in 2025, whether viewed as a trend or a media moment, offers broader insights: It reflects how fame magnifies normal relationship challenges like communication breakdowns, mismatched schedules, or diverging life paths. It underscores the shifting cultural attitude toward relationships: more people, even in the public eye, prefer personal fulfilment over maintaining what they deem a facade. It demonstrates the impact of media scrutiny: once-private matters are now broadcast globally, leaving little room for quiet transitions or personal healing. While the high-profile breakups of 2025 may appear unusually frequent, evidence suggests celebrity relationships have long been precarious. What's new is visibility and perhaps a changing mindset prioritising mental health and personal growth. Either way, love under the spotlight remains fragile.",

Angesichts des hohen Alters vieler Betroffener dringt Polens Premier Tusk auf eine schnelle Entschädigung der NS-Opfer in seinem Land. Noch eine andere Frage belastet die Beziehungen zwischen beiden Ländern. Polens Regierungschef Donald Tusk hat die Bundesregierung aufgefordert, möglichst schnell Unterstützung für die noch lebenden Opfer der deutschen Besatzung in Polen während des Zweiten Weltkriegs zu leisten. \"Beeilt euch, wenn ihr wirklich diese Geste machen wollt\", sagte Tusk in Berlin nach einem Treffen mit Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU) im Rahmen der 17. deutsch-polnischen Regierungskonsultationen. Tusk verwies darauf, dass die Zahl der noch lebenden Opfer des Nazi-Terrors in seinem Land ständig zurückgehe. Als der damalige Kanzler Olaf Scholz im Juli 2024 diese Unterstützung versprochen habe, habe es nach Angaben der Stiftung für deutsch-polnische Aussöhnung noch 60. 000 lebende Opfer gegeben, mittlerweile seien es noch 50. 000. \"Wenn wir hier nicht bald eine eindeutige und schnelle Erklärung bekommen, erwäge ich, im kommenden Jahr die Entscheidung zu treffen, dass Polen diese Bedürfnisse aus eigenen Mitteln befriedigt.\" Mehr wolle er dazu zunächst nicht sagen. Scholz hatte im Polen im vergangenen Jahr eine Summe von rund 200 Millionen Euro in Aussicht gestellt. Damit sollten unter anderem Opfer des deutschen Besatzungsregimes während des Zweiten Weltkriegs entschädigt werden. Doch wirft das Vorgehen rechtliche Fragen auf, weil auch andere Länder wie Griechenland eine mögliche Entschädigung fordern. Der Umgang mit den dramatischen Folgen der deutschen Besatzung Polens im Zweiten Weltkrieg ist ein Dauerthema in den Beziehungen beider Länder. Neben den Entschädigungen für NS-Opfer stehen weiterhin polnische Reparationsforderungen in Billionenhöhe für die damals angerichteten Schäden im Raum.",

            "content": "It feels like everyone I know's gone batty for Dispatch, AdHoc's superhero management sim that picks up Telltale's choose-your-own-adventure torch and runs with it to, so I hear, great success. A particular triumph? Its episodic release structure, which even won over our Fraser Brown-noted episode-sceptic-quite quickly. Indeed, the game's executive producer Michael Choung said the format had \"absolutely proven itself\" two weeks ago-sustaining interest in the game over a longer period than a one-and-done release likely would have. But Choung doesn't see the approach as some kind of magic bullet AdHoc-or any studio-can just apply to everything. \"It's insane to do,\" he told Edge's Knowledge newsletter. \"From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this.\" The game's lead producer, Natalie Herman, agreed with Choung: \"From a production perspective, we released four times. We were basically a live-service game for a month.\" The point Choung is making isn't that episodic releases ought to be avoided-that'd be an odd move from a developer whose game is on-track to beat its three-year \"bull case\" sales projections in three months-but rather that anyone looking on and getting ideas ought to realise it's just one part of a bigger puzzle. \"If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!\" What's the heart of Dispatch's success, per Choung? \"If the creative is strong, you can cut it up however you like, and it probably is going to make it through, even if it's a poor decision.\" Case in point: Choung reckons if AdHoc had put out Dispatch all at once, \"it probably would have done okay. But it probably wouldn't have been as big as this.\" Choung says applying an episodic release structure to a game without the story chops to back it up is \"flirting with people that aren't attracted to you whatsoever.\" His advice? Think of episodic releases as a \"multiplier\" for whatever you have already. \"If it's good, then it's going to do better. And if it's not, honestly, it's not going to save you. It might even be worse.\" Which, you know, seems reasonable to me, although I'd note that I reckon a big reason Dispatch caught on like it did is that the wait between episodes wasn't gargantuan. Back in the days of early Telltale, you'd sometimes be waiting upwards of a month for a new episode, which is a recipe for enthusiasm to ebb, not flow. Dispatch's weekly cadence did it a lot of favours, in my book.",

His time here was filled with memorable victories, a historic run of consecutive bowl appearances, and a commitment to developing young men both on and off the field.” Barnhart said the university is “committed to build upon the strong foundation that has been laid” and has already launched a national search for the next head coach. “We move forward committed to build upon the strong foundation that has been laid and to pursue excellence relentlessly,” Barnhart said. “Kentucky Football is positioned for success. We will continue to make the necessary investments to recruit an elite head coach, players, and support staff. That includes fully funding revenue-sharing and NIL opportunities, providing state-of-the-art facilities, and ensuring our student-athletes have every resource to thrive.” He added that Big Blue Nation’s “passion and loyalty” help make Kroger Field “one of the best environments in college football.” University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto also issued a statement supporting Barnhart’s decision. “After a review that he conducts every year, Mitch is making a change in the head coaching position of our football team,” Capilouto said. “I support his decision and will work with him to make a hire that will achieve the levels of success the Big Blue Nation expects and that we all want.” Capilouto thanked Stoops for his 13 years of service, saying he “helped lead the revival of this program and achieved historic results.” “It is critically important that we are competitive and successful in football,” Capilouto added. “That is our goal. It is our focus. We intend to be successful.” Stoops leaves Kentucky as the longest-tenured coach in program history, with multiple bowl appearances and national rankings during his run. The university will have to come up with nearly $38 million to pay out what’s left on Stoops’ contract.",

The perpetrator ran off the train at the station in an unknown direction. The startled victim remained on the northbound E train and was not injured during the encounter, police said. The NYPD released an image of the suspect, who has a medium complexion with curly hair with a goatee and is approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall and 140 pounds.

            "content": "Japón tiene una habilidad especial para transformar ideas extravagantes en tecnología real. Y esta vez lo hizo con una propuesta que parece sacada de una película de ciencia ficción: una lavadora para seres humanos. Una máquina capaz de lavar, aclarar y secar a una persona en apenas 15 minutos. No es un concepto, no es un prototipo en papel: se presentó oficialmente en la Expo Osaka 2025. Una cabina futurista que lava como una ducha. pero sin esfuerzo El dispositivo, bautizado como Future Human Washing Machine, está diseñado para funcionar como una cabina individual. El usuario entra, se recuesta y deja que la máquina lo haga todo. Primero se inyecta agua con jabón por el interior de la cápsula. Después, la pantalla integrada activa una experiencia sensorial con música y vídeos relajantes, como si fuera un spa encapsulado. Luego llega la parte clave: el aclarado mediante microburbujas de agua, capaces de eliminar impurezas sin necesidad de chorros de alta presión. Al terminar, un sistema de secado automático deja al usuario completamente limpio y sin una gota de humedad. En total: 15 minutos de principio a fin. El invento es real y tiene un precio digno de ciencia ficción La responsable del desarrollo es Science, una empresa japonesa conocida por fabricar alcachofas de ducha avanzadas. Decidieron dar un salto radical y crear un dispositivo que automatiza por completo la higiene personal. No será barato: cada unidad cuesta alrededor de 60 millones de yenes, unos 330. 000 euros, y solo se producirán unas 50. Principalmente estarán destinadas a hoteles y spas de lujo, aunque el interés del público ha sido tan grande que la compañía no descarta ampliar la producción. ¿Para qué sirve realmente una lavadora humana? A primera vista parece un gadget extravagante, pero tiene sentido en ciertos entornos. Los asistentes a la Expo señalaron que la máquina “resuelve un problema que no sabían que tenían”: controlar al milímetro el tiempo dedicado a ducharse. También podría ser útil en instalaciones médicas, centros de rehabilitación, residencias o lugares donde sea necesario optimizar agua y tiempo. Además, su diseño busca reducir el consumo de agua y automatizar procesos que normalmente requieren supervisión o asistencia.",

            "content": "President Trump's quest to install Alina Habba, his former personal defense lawyer, as U. S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey hit another legal roadblock Monday after an appeals court ruled Habba was unlawfully serving as the state's top federal prosecutor. It's the latest move in a months-long legal chess game in which the courts repeatedly undo the president's effort to place Habba in the important blue state role. In a unanimous vote, a three-judge panel for the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, sitting in Philadelphia, said that a lower court ruling was correct in disqualifying Habba from serving in the role. The panel concluded that the Trump administration’s attempts to keep Habba in the role would \"effectively [permit] anyone to fill the U. S. Attorney role indefinitely,\" with the panel adding that \"this should raise a red flag.\" READ MORE: Breaking: Federal Judge Declares Appointment of Trump's Personal Lawyer As US Attorney Illegal Alina Habba Rejected by Federal Judges for Permanent Role As U. S. Attorney for District of New Jersey Here's \"Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U. S. Attorney indefinitely,\" the ruling said. This saga all started back in March when Trump appointed Habba to the position on an interim basis, which meant she could serve as Acting U. S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey for 120 days. The president then nominated her for the permanent role in June, but the U. S. Senate failed to act on her nomination; he withdrew her nomination on July 24. On that same day, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Habba to the role of a special attorney who could conduct \"any kind of legal proceedings . which United States Attorneys are authorized to conduct.\" That move led to U. S. District Judge Matthew Brann to rule in August that Habba had been acting without legal authority for the previous two months and her actions could be considered void. RedState's streiff did a masterful job of summarizing the legal wrangling over Habba's appointment here; he concluded: Because of Senator Thune's inability or unwillingness to break the logjam holding up nominations, several interim U. S. Attorneys are facing a vote by a group of judges. Most of those are going for the administration, but there are a couple that seem doomed to follow Habba's rejection. To streiff's point, Alina Habba isn't the only Trump appointee to find their job enmeshed in a legal quagmire. Lindsay Halligan, Trump's pick for U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, had her appointment ruled \"defective\" last month. And Bill Essayli, chosen by the president to be Acting U. S. Attorney for the Central District of California, was disqualified after a federal judge ruled in October that Essayli was unlawfully serving in the role because his nomination had failed to be considered by the U. S. Senate. As for Monday's ruling against Alina Habba, the panel had a message for the Trump administration: “It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,” senior US Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher wrote in the 32-page ruling. “Its efforts to elevate its preferred candidate for US Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Alina Habba, to the role of Acting US Attorney demonstrate the difficulties it has faced-yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the US Attorney’s Office deserve some clarity and stability.” As of this writing, the Trump White House had not commented on the ruling. Next steps could be for the administration to ask a full panel of 3rd Circuit judges to reconsider the decision or going right to the U. S. Supreme Court. Editor's Note: Radical leftist judges are doing everything they can to hamstring President Trump's agenda to make America great again.",

            "content": "Anzeige Beide Länder setzen sich für einen Frieden in der Ukraine ein. Doch bei der Frage nach Deutschlands Verantwortung 86 Jahre nach Beginn des Zweiten Weltkrieg gehen die Meinungen weit auseinander, wie sich einmal mehr in Berlin zeigt. Polen drängt Deutschland zu einer schnellen Entschädigung der noch lebenden Opfer der deutschen Besatzung im Zweiten Weltkrieg. „Beeilt euch, wenn ihr wirklich diese Geste machen wollt“, sagte Polens Ministerpräsident Donald Tusk nach den deutsch-polnischen Regierungskonsultationen in Berlin bei einer Pressekonferenz mit Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU). Der polnische Regierungschef verwies darauf, dass die Zahl der noch lebenden Opfer des Nazi-Terrors in seinem Land ständig zurückgehe. Als der damalige Kanzler Olaf Scholz im Juli 2024 diese Unterstützung versprochen habe, hätte es nach Angaben der Stiftung für deutsch-polnische Aussöhnung noch 60. 000 lebende Opfer gegeben, mittlerweile seien es noch 50. 000. Rechnet man das um, sind seitdem pro Tag mehr als 20 Opfer gestorben. Anzeige Lesen Sie auch Scholz hatte die individuelle Geste an die Opfer bei den letzten Regierungskonsultationen versprochen. Ein konkreter Vorschlag wurde daraus aber nicht. Merz bekannte sich auf der gemeinsamen Pressekonferenz mit Tusk zwar zur deutschen Verantwortung für das die von Nazi-Deutschland angerichtete Leid und Zerstörung in Polen. „Die Vergangenheit hört nie auf“, sagte er. „Erinnerung und Aufarbeitung werden für uns niemals abgeschlossen sein. Deutschland steht zu seiner historischen Verantwortung.“ Der Kanzler bekräftigte aber auch die seit Jahrzehnten geltende deutsche Haltung, dass die Reparationsfrage abgeschlossen sei. „Die Frage nach Reparationen ist aus deutscher Sicht juristisch und politisch seit vielen Jahren abschließend beantwortet.“ Anzeige Kriegsvergangenheit Dauerthema in Beziehungen Der deutsche Überfall auf Polen am 1. September 1939 war der Beginn des Zweiten Weltkriegs mit insgesamt mindestens 55 Millionen Toten andere Schätzungen kommen sogar auf bis zu 80 Millionen. Genaue Zahlen gibt es nicht. Polen blieb über mehrere Jahre von den Deutschen besetzt und hatte gemessen an der Gesamtbevölkerung so viele Tote zu beklagen wie kein anderes Land. Der Umgang mit den dramatischen Folgen der deutschen Besatzung Polens im Zweiten Weltkrieg ist ein Dauerthema in den Beziehungen beider Länder. Weiterhin stehen polnischen Reparationsforderungen in Billionenhöhe für die damals angerichteten Schäden im Raum, die zuletzt im September von Polens Präsidenten Karol Nawrocki bei seinem Antrittsbesuch in Berlin erhoben und von Merz und Bundespräsident Frank-Walter Steinmeier zurückgewiesen wurden. Lesen Sie auch Anders als der rechtskonservative Präsident Polens thematisiert die Mitte-Links-Regierung von Ministerpräsident Tusk die Reparationsfrage nicht mehr offensiv sie erwartet von der Bundesregierung aber zunächst einmal mindestens diese Geste der Unterstützung für die noch lebenden Opfer. Das Projekt einer festen Gedenkstätte für die polnischen Kriegsopfer in Berlin wollen beide Seiten aber vorantreiben. Dafür sollen konkrete Ausschreibungsverfahren gestartet werden. Vertiefte Zusammenarbeit im Verteidigungsbereich Im Zentrum der Konsultationen stand eigentlich die Vertiefung der Beziehungen in den Bereichen Verteidigung, Wirtschaft und Infrastruktur. Tusk wertete die Ergebnisse des Treffens als „eine historische Veränderung“. Er würdigte vor allem die „umfassende polnisch-deutsche Zusammenarbeit in Bezug auf die Verteidigung der Ostgrenze Europas bezeichnen“. Dazu soll zum 35. Jubiläum des deutsch-polnischen Nachbarschaftsvertrags im nächsten Jahr ein Abkommen mit konkreten Projekten unterzeichnet werden. Lesen Sie auch Merz nannte Deutschland und Polen „unverzichtbare Nachbarn und Partner“. Bei der Modernisierung der Infrastruktur geht es unter anderem um die Bahnlinie zwischen dem brandenburgischen Angermünde und der polnischen Grenzstadt Stettin sowie um die Straßenverbindung an der Grenze bei Frankfurt an der Oder. Wie läuft es in der Ukraine-Politik? Merz beschwor auch die Einigkeit europäischer Partner bei den Ukraine-Verhandlungen. Beide kamen aus einem Telefonat mit dem ukrainischen Präsidenten Wolodymyr Selenskyj, dem französischen Staatschef Emmanuel Macron, dem britischen Regierungschef Keir Starmer und anderen europäischen Partnern. Zu dem strategischen Ziele gehöre es, alles in der Macht Stehende zu tun, um Kiew gegenüber dem russischen Aggressor beizustehen. „Wir wollen dabei nun den stärksten Hebel nutzen, der uns zur Verfügung steht, um Moskau endlich an den Verhandlungstisch zu bringen. Zusammen wollen wir in Brüssel durchsetzen, dass wir die eingefrorenen russischen Vermögenswerte nutzen“, sagte Merz. Lesen Sie auch Anfang Mai war Merz zusammen mit Tusk, Macron und Starmer in Kiew, um die Solidarität mit der Ukraine zu demonstrieren. Den aktuellen Verhandlungsprozess über einen Friedensplan führen nun aber Deutschland, Frankreich und Großbritannien ohne Polen, das lediglich konsultiert wird obwohl Polen als Nachbarland der Ukraine und Russlands besonders von dem Krieg betroffen ist. In Polen hat das zuletzt für Enttäuschung gesorgt. „Derzeit sieht es so aus, als wären wir bei den Verhandlungen überflüssig“, schrieb die „Gazeta Wyborcza“, eines der wichtigsten polnischen Medien, kurz vor den Konsultationen. dpa/saha.",

Councilmember with ties to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) has announced a bid for mayor of the nation's capital. Councilmember Janeese Lewis George issued a statement on Monday that she is launching a mayoral campaign, aiming to succeed long-serving Mayor Muriel Bowser, who is not pursuing re-election. The progressive Democrat said that \"too many residents still feel squeezed financially, from unaffordable housing to childcare, and feel unsafe in their neighborhoods. Residents face uneven access to opportunity and a city government that on its best days feels unresponsive, and on its worst, is leaving residents out in the cold all because leaders have chosen to prioritize the needs of the well-connected over us. \"That’s wrong, it’s not the DC we should be and that’s why I’m running for Mayor,\" she added. WHERE THE TRUMP ADMIN'S COURT FIGHT OVER NATIONAL GUARD IN DC STANDS IN WAKE OF SHOOTING Bowswer, who has been in office since 2015, announced last month that she will not run for a fourth term. \"DC is a place that honors and celebrates its leaders. We will always be grateful for Mayor Bowser’s devoted public service and impactful leadership,\" George said in a post responding to Bowser's announcement. The mayoral hopeful first won her seat on the council in a 2020 election, in which she was supported by the DSA. Upon her victory, the organization congratulated her in a press release that referred to her as \"our chapter member and endorsed candidate[.]\" BOWSER ENDS DECADE-LONG REIGN AS DC MAYOR AFTER 3 TERMS IN OFFICE, WON'T SEEK FOURTH Earlier this year when President Donald Trump moved to leverage the National Guard and D. C. Metropolitan Police Department to crack down on crime in the nation's capital, George was a vocal critic.

            "content": "Segons Illa, la relació entre les dues ciutats \"demana\" que hi hagi aquesta connexió aèria, tot i que la proposta és molt a les beceroles. \"Hi posarem tot el suport institucional i del tipus que calgui perquè sigui una realitat\", ha assegurat Illa. L'anunci s'ha fet durant un acte a Casa Jalisco, residència oficial del governador, on aquest dilluns els dos governs han signat un acord de col·laboració entre els dos territoris en l'àmbit de les tecnologies digitals avançades, la supercomputació i la intel·ligència artificial. Aquest acord entre els dos governs preveu l'impuls de la cooperació entre centres de recerca i investigació. De fet, la proposta d'obrir un vol directe entre les dues capitals és, per a Illa, una \"concreció\" per \"facilitar l'intercanvi de relacions\" entre els dos territoris. El president de la Generalitat, ha destacat el compromís amb \"la generació de prosperitat i el desenvolupament econòmic, industrial i tecnològic\" dels dos governs com a principals punts d'unió entre Catalunya i Jalisco: \"Tenim moltes possibilitats i punts en comú per enriquir-nos mútuament\". En aquest context, Illa també ha anunciat que Catalunya prepara una estratègia global per \"potenciar els llaços\" amb Amèrica Llatina que comptarà amb el suport del govern espanyol. Illa i Lemus ja es van reunir a l'abril al Palau de la Generalitat i aquesta trobada a la capital de Jalisco serveix ara per segellar l'inici de la cooperació entre els dos territoris. Els caps de governs han destacat les potencialitats compartides entre Jalisco i Catalunya en l'àmbit tecnològic Jalisco és una de les regions amb un dinamisme econòmic i cultural més elevat de Mèxic i és una de les capitals tecnològiques d'Amèrica Llatina. En aquest sentit, Guadalajara es considera el Silicon Valley de Mèxic per ser un pol important de la indústria tecnològica i d'innovació. El seu governador, Pablo Lemus, ha dit emmirallar-se en Catalunya en l'àmbit de la supercomputació per \"seguir creixent\". A banda de la signatura de l'acord de col·laboració amb l'estat de Jalisco i la visita oficial a la FIL, Illa té programades quatre reunions més per a aquest dilluns. A primera hora, el president s'ha reunit ja amb els rectors de les universitats catalanes desplaçades a la FIL, la UB, la UAB i la UPF. També en clau catalana, Illa s'ha pogut trobar una estona amb alguns dels escriptors catalans presents a la Fira del Llibre, com Carme Riera, Victòria Szpunberg i Josep Maria Miró. En l'àmbit internacional, el president català es reuneix també amb l'ambaixador de la Unió Europea a Mèxic, Francisco André. Finalment, després d'inaugurar l'estand de Catalunya a la FIL, Illa mantindrà també una trobada amb joves artistes catalans.",

            "content": "El alcalde de Málaga, Francisco de la Torre, se ha referido este lunes al comienzo, desde este pasado domingo, del segundo año de vigencia de la ordenanza de Movilidad Sostenible y a las nuevas restricciones en la Zona de Bajas Emisiones (ZBE). Así, ha dicho que espera que «se vea como algo que es positivo para todos». Así lo ha señalado De la Torre, que ha incidido en que «se trata de que apostemos más por el transporte público, que usemos menos el coche particular y que vayamos también cambiando los coches particulares que, digamos, contaminan a coches que sean más sostenibles desde el punto de vista ambiental». «Eso nos interesa a todos», ha apostillado. Al respecto, ha señalado que se tiene que ser «de una manera gradual» y ha recordado que «hay ayudas». «Tenemos que ir en esa dirección. Y lo hemos hecho de una manera muy suave, muy flexible» en relación con las personas que tienen el coche domiciliado en Málaga. En relación con los de «fuera», De la Torre ha incidido en que «vamos a trabajar intensamente para tener los aparcamientos disuasorios para que puedan ir a dejar el coche y puedan luego coger el transporte público». «Ese es el camino por nuestra parte», ha dicho, al tiempo que ha agregado que queda «el transporte interurbano mejorarlo», pero «es un tema que desborda nuestra capacidad tiene que ser desde la propia Junta y desde el Gobierno central los que vayan apoyando y ayudando». Entre otros, ha recordado que, por ejemplo, el Cercanías del Valle del Guadalahorce «debe tener más frecuencia». En relación con los aparcamientos disuasorios, ha dicho que se harán «cuanto antes, iremos avanzando. Son muchos frentes con los cuales trabajamos. Ahora estamos muy absorbidos el tema de la vivienda, porque ese tema también estamos trabajando». «Aparcamientos, tanto en el este, al lado del arroyo Totalán, como en la zona oeste, la zona de Martín Carpena, están proyectados y en marcha», ha abundado el regidor. Vehículo domiciliado De igual modo, ha pedido «paciencia» a los conductores que no tengan el coche domiciliado en Málaga en relación con la Zona de Bajas Emisiones (ZBE). «Pueden entrar, lo que no pueden es hacer el recorrido. Tienen que tener cuidado de rodearlo nada más. Yo diría que paciencia, conocerlo bien e iremos trabajando todo», ha sostenido, ya que «es tarea de todos». Ha agregado que «no pidamos al ayuntamiento en España -Málaga es un ayuntamiento español- lo que en Europa sí tienen muchísimas competencias, tienen más recursos, pero en España los ayuntamientos no tenemos recursos para los temas interurbanos, esa es la realidad». «El transporte interurbano es un tema que está a nivel nacional y a nivel autonómico», ha señalado. El segundo año de vigencia de la ordenanza de Movilidad Sostenible de la ciudad de Málaga comenzó este pasado domingo, 30 de noviembre. Cabe recordar que el Boletín Oficial de la provincia publicó el pasado 29 de noviembre de 2024 el nuevo texto normativo por el cual se regula el acceso y la circulación por la Zona de Bajas Emisiones (ZBE). Durante este primer año de vigencia han circulado por la ZBE los vehículos (coches y motos) acreditados por la DGT con etiqueta ambiental ‘CERO’, ‘ECO’ o ‘C’; los que tienen etiqueta ambiental ‘B’; y los que carecen de etiqueta ambiental, han recordado desde el Ayuntamiento de Málaga en un comunicado. Así, desde este pasado domingo comenzó el segundo año y, por tanto, se restringe la circulación a los vehículos que no tengan etiqueta medioambiental y que no estuvieran domiciliados en Málaga antes de la entrada en vigor de la ordenanza de Movilidad Sostenible (30 de noviembre de 2024). Todos los demás tipos (‘CERO’, ‘ECO’, ‘C’ y ‘B’), domiciliados o no en Málaga, podrán seguir circulando.",

            "content": "A civil lawsuit has ignited a storm around Turning Point USA, alleging that a female staffer propositioned a male colleague for sex, and, when rebuffed, spiralled into what the complaint describes as an alleged kidnapping of his teenage daughter. The case accuses TPUSA staffer and Avondale City Council member Jeannette Garcia of exploiting her professional authority by making explicit sexual propositions to a male employee she supervised, and later removing his 14-year-old daughter from their home under what the plaintiffs describe as 'false pretences' and 'manipulation'. These claims, if proven, could raise profound questions about safeguarding and organisational governance within TPUSA at a moment when political youth groups are under heightened national scrutiny. Sexual Harassment Allegations Erupt The lawsuit, filed on 14 November 2025 under pseudonyms Father John Doe and Minor Jane Doe, claims that the incident occurred during a post-election celebration among staff of TPUSA at a restaurant in Goodyear, Phoenix suburb. According to the court filing, the accused, Garcia, who at the time was also employed by TPUSA, approached the male employee she supervised and made repeated sexual advances. She allegedly offered him employment with TPUSA in exchange for sex. He declined, telling the suit he 'repeatedly rebuffed' her overtures. The plaintiff says that Garcia's behaviour deteriorated sharply after what he described as 'excessive consumption of alcohol'. Confronted by the advances and growing aggressiveness, he departed the event and headed home shortly after midnight. Alleged Kidnapping of Teen Daughter The suit alleges that when the father arrived home roughly 45 minutes later, his 14-year-old daughter was nowhere to be found. According to the complaint, deputies from the county sheriff's office informed the father that his daughter was 'safe' and in the custody of Garcia. The man said the deputies claimed she was with her 'guardian' Garcia, but did not explain how she came to be there. The father reportedly tried contacting both his daughter and Garcia multiple times without success. Finally, at about 02: 20 a. m., Garcia allegedly answered and confirmed she had the girl. The filing claims that Garcia, described as 'extremely intoxicated', along with two other adults, 'manipulated' the teenager into a car by telling her that her father had been drinking and might become violent. The complaint states the daughter was taken without permission or consent and remained in Garcia's care overnight, effectively amounting to false imprisonment. The child was reportedly returned only the next day, after her grandmother called Garcia, from a number the councilwoman did not immediately recognise, and arranged to meet her at a restaurant to pick her up. The lawsuit details emotional and psychological harm. The daughter was allegedly left 'depressed' and 'terrified' to leave her room, with a marked decline in academic performance and extracurricular participation. Legal Claims and Background Filed in the Maricopa County Superior Court, the lawsuit names Garcia, the deputised county officers allegedly involved, and even TPUSA-affiliated employees. The charges include sexual harassment, civil conspiracy, and false imprisonment. To date, no criminal charges have been filed against Garcia. The case remains a civil complaint, and the plaintiffs are seeking damages, though the amount is not publicly disclosed in the filings. The case underscores a troubling intersection between workplace misconduct and alleged abuse of authority for personal gain, in this case, a so-called 'job-for-sex' proposition by a supervisor. Opponents of TPUSA argue the allegations cast a harsh light on the group's internal culture, particularly as the accused held both a political office and an influential role within a national political organisation. Denial and the Wider Reputation Fallout In a statement to local media, Garcia denied all allegations. She called them 'outrageous and false' and said she had 'never kidnapped anyone, never harmed anyone, and never solicited anything inappropriate'. She added that she was considering legal action against those she claims are defaming her. TPUSA, which has previously been the subject of scrutiny for other controversies, has not issued any official statement referring to the lawsuit, nor confirmed whether she remains employed by the organisation. Media reached out to both organisation and the county sheriff's office, but this yielded no response. The case provokes questions about potential complicity by law enforcement. The lawsuit claims the deputies present at the time either failed to act or facilitated the alleged removal of a minor from her home, a serious assertion that could trigger investigations beyond the civil domain.",

The victims were cousins, according to a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for funeral expenses. Police said Avila was driving a white GMC with Morales and three juveniles inside when he collided with a woman driving a silver Hyundai. The three children and the woman driving the silver Hyundai all received non-life-threatening injuries in the crash, police said. The crash led to an extended closure of the Loop 101 off-ramps at Bell Road. The investigation into this crash is still underway.",

            "pub_date": "2025-12-01T17:07:16",
            "creator": "Salamanca 24 Horas",
            "content": "El Comité Antisida de Salamanca lleva 40 años saliendo a la calle el 1 de diciembre para concienciar a la sociedad salmantina de la importancia de que no caiga en el olvido que el VIH sigue presente. El gélido primer lunes de diciembre no ha sido impedimento para que su carpa haya vuelto a colocarse en la plaza del Liceo. Lo hacen, como cada año, por tres motivos fundamentales. “El primero es la protección, porque es la única vacuna que existe hoy por hoy. Desde los comienzos y hasta hoy en día, y lo que nos falte, la única vacuna que existe es la prevención”, cuenta Carlos Rodrigo, miembro de la Junta Directiva del Comité. El segundo motivo es una llamada de atención: “Cualquier persona que tenga una práctica de riesgo, lo mejor es hacerse una prueba, puesto que cuanto antes se pueda detectar la infección, más fácil es que no evolucione el virus”. Por último, el Comité no quiere olvidarse de aquellos que se llevó la enfermedad: “Hoy también es un día para hacer un recordatorio de todas las personas que han fallecido por causa del VIH y por ello también damos el lazo rojo conmemorativo”. Como medida de protección y concienciación, desde la propia carpa situada en la plaza del Liceo hacen entrega de diferentes tipos de objetos de protección sexual, así como panfletos informativos. Una forma de intentar apelar a las nuevas generaciones: “Hay que educar en la percepción del riesgo, porque creemos que la está bajando en ellos. Nosotros cuando vamos a colegios o institutos ya nos dicen los críos y las crías que esto es una enfermedad de viejos o que a ellos no les va a tocar. Con esto quiero decir que no son conscientes de que cualquier práctica en la que no utilices un medio de protección te puede infectar, pero no solo de VIH, sino de cualquier ETS”. Para el Comité Antisida la enfermedad todavía crea muchos estigmas. “El primero es el autoestigma. Cualquier persona recién diagnosticada lo primero que te pregunta es, ¿me voy a morir? Es decir, todavía existe en el subconsciente colectivo de que el VIH es una enfermedad mortal. Y hoy por ahí, con los avances terapéuticos y sanitarios, una persona con un VIH puede vivir la misma cantidad y calidad de vida que una persona sin un VIH”, reflexiona Carlos Rodrigo en declaraciones a este medio. \"Piensan que al ser heterosexuales ya estas vacunado, que no te va a tocar nada”. Añade, además, que no solo existe el desconocimiento del propio paciente, sino que él mismo se crea un estigma por el posible rechazo social: “lo primero que hace es callárselo para evitar la discriminación y lo vive en solitario. El no comentarlo ni a la familia más cercana, ni a los amigos lo hacen como medida de prevención, para evitar el rechazo. De ahí viene también mucho de lo que hacemos en el Comité, que es un movimiento para que la gente sepa que no está sola, que podéis vivir perfectamente”. Preguntamos a Carlos si cree que la sociedad sigue pensando que el VIH solo lo contraen hombres homosexuales o drogodependientes: “si lo creen, hoy por hoy es falso. Fue verdad en los orígenes con las famosas cuatro haches, es decir, heroinómanos, homosexuales, haitianos y hemofílicos. Sin embargo, actualmente cualquier relación sexual, sea homosexual o heterosexual, puede transmitir el VIH”. En esa línea Carlos Rodrigo defiende que existe una falsa creencia y mucha menos percepción del riesgo en las relaciones heterosexuales: “Los vemos claramente con los datos epidemiológicos. Las personas que han tenido relaciones sexuales de este tipo y que han sido diagnosticadas recientemente, tienen un retraso en el diagnóstico. Es decir, que hace cuatro o cinco años tuvieron el contacto de riesgo y existió la transmisión, pero no se hicieron una prueba porque pensaban que al ser heterosexuales ya estabas vacunado, que no te va a tocar nada”. Por último, piden a la sociedad y a la clase política medidas para una mejor educación sexual: “En este país brilla por su ausencia. La mejor manera de frenar no solo infecciones por VIH, sino cualquier otro tipo de ETS, es la educación. Esto es algo que llevamos reivindicado desde los orígenes y creemos que tiene que haber una buena programación en las escuelas, colegios e institutos. Aquí no vale solo que un día vaya alguien de Cruz Roja o de nuestro Comité a darte una charla”, finaliza Carlos Rodrigo, representante del Comité Antisida de Salamanca.",

            "content": "CHICAGO (AP) A son of notorious Mexican drug kingpin “El Chapo” was set Monday to change his not guilty plea in a U. S. drug trafficking case, months after his brother entered a plea deal. Joaquin Guzman Lopez had been scheduled to be in court Monday in Chicago for a status hearing, but a court document said the appearance would now be a change-of-plea hearing. The document didn’t say whether he would be pleading guilty, and Jeffrey Lichtman, Joaquin Guzman Lopez’s attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Known locally as the “Chapitos,” or “little Chapos,” Joaquin Guzman Lopez and his brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, are accused of running a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. Federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the U. S. Joaquin Guzman Lopez and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the U. S. on a private plane. Both men have previously pleaded not guilty to various drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico’s northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed. Ovidio Guzman Lopez was the first son of drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman to enter a plea deal, for which he admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually. Ovidio Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Legal experts called the plea deal a significant step for the U. S. government in their investigation and prosecution of Sinaloa cartel leaders. Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father’s former role as leaders of the cartel.",

            "content": "Didn’t get a chance to grab a solid tablet during Black Friday? Don’t worry. Cyber Monday is here, slashing prices across all popular categories, and offering one last chance to save massively before the holiday season begins. We’ve been spotting tons of great options going for less, and if you’re after something that covers all the basics while staying under the $100 mark, the Lenovo Tab One is an excellent option to consider. It’s now sitting at just $90, after a nice 25% discount, and there are no delivery charges to worry about either. It’s not every day you get to grab an impressive screen while also saving on shipping, so get your orders in sooner rather than later. The tablet is going to be pushed back to its retail price of $120 at midnight, which is why it’s best to act fast. See at Amazon Bright Visuals, Even Better Sound We won’t label it as a massive tablet. You’re getting a modest 8. 7-inch display, which isn’t overwhelmingly large; just enough for a comfortable viewing experience on the go. The display pushes vibrant visuals, while the 480 nits of brightness ensure exceptional visibility in all lighting conditions. Of course, visuals alone aren’t enough for an immersive streaming experience, which is why Lenovo packs the tablet with dual Dolby Atmos speakers for bold, rich audio. Translation? Brighter content, paired with an even better sound that brings your favorite content to life. Performance is taken care of by the MediaTek Helio G85 processor, plus a 60Hz refresh rate, both of which come together to ensure a smooth, lag-free experience. You won’t exactly be able to multitask on this tablet, but it holds up well for casual use like browsing, streaming, video calls, etc. In fact, it’s a great option for kids, too. Google Kids Space support lets you introduce your little ones to teacher-approved content based on their interests. . Storing all the media content and programs you want won’t be an issue, thanks to the massive 64GB of storage, which is quite rare to find in this price range. If you’re purchasing it for your kids, you can pre-install a bunch of kid-friendly apps and games to keep them entertained for hours. There’s an included folio case to protect your tablet from the inevitable daily wear and tear. The built-in stand lets you prop it up wherever you like, however you prefer it. Place it on your workstation, a cafe, or even your bed for some late-night streaming sessions. As for the battery, a single charge gets you around 12. 5 hours of unplugged YouTube streaming. It’s also designed to recharge faster than previous models, so it should be back at it in no time when running low. And since the tablet is compact, you don’t have to get a dedicated bag to carry it. Just toss it in your purse or backpack, and you’re good to go. To wrap it up, this tablet isn’t a powerhouse. It’s made to do all the basic tasks, and it does those well. We especially recommend it for kids/teenagers wanting to have their own device. The current deal brings it down to just $90, which is pretty cheap for a tablet from a known brand. It’s also one of the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer ends soon. Grab yours before it’s too late.",

            "description": "In one of the latest setbacks for the Trump administration, New Jersey's acting U. S. attorney has been disqualified from the role after an appeal by the government. On Monday, an appellate court ruled that New Jersey acting U. S. Attorney Alina Habba, a Trump appointee, is disqualified from the role. 'It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place.'A panel of three judges on the 3rd U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals two George W. Bush appointees and one Obama appointee unanimously affirmed a lower-court judge's ruling against Habba's appointment. “It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place. Its efforts to elevate its preferred candidate for U. S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Alina Habba, to the role of Acting U. S. Attorney demonstrate the difficulties it has faced yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U. S. Attorney’s Office deserve some clarity and stability,” the court wrote, according to the Associated Press. Habba was sworn in as interim U. S. attorney for New Jersey on March 28 of this year, replacing John Giordano, now the ambassador to Namibia. The Trump administration has fought tirelessly to keep his appointed U. S. attorneys in their positions, including Bill Essayli in the Central District of California and Sigal Chattah in Nevada. Like Blaze News?

Aquí es donde entra en escena Marcelo Figoli, que es presidente de la entidad burgalesa y, a la vez, está inmiscuido en la modernización del Parque de Atracciones. Este jueves, su equipo debe jugar en el Ibercaja Estadio. Este lunes ya se ha comenzado a preparar el partido en la Ciudad Deportiva del Real Zaragoza. Todo con la vista a recibir al Burgos C. F. el día jueves 4 a las 21. 00 horas. Pues es aquí cuando debería visitar el estadio zaragozano el gestor del Parque de Atracciones. Por cierto, a su cargo está el proyecto de modernización del mismo. Además, el Real Zaragoza y el Burgos deben volver a verse las caras en 20 días, en El Plantío, para disputar el partido de liga de la jornada 19. LA HISTORIA El presidente del Burgos, a través de Fenix Entertainment, entidad que también preside, se unió a la familia Morte, principal gestora del Parque de Atracciones, el pasado mes de septiembre. Fue el inicio de una nueva etapa en el recinto, que contó con una inversión de 15 millones. Gracias a ella, está en marcha el proyecto con el que se prevé dar un importante lavado de cara. Figoli, entre otras cuestiones, está metido en el mundo del fútbol español a través del Burgos, que ahora mismo se sitúa por encima del Real Zaragoza. Concretamente, en el puesto quinto, que si lo mantiene, le otorga el premio a disputar el playoff a Primera División. Por contra, el Real Zaragoza se encuentra en la parte baja de la tabla, colista. Es decir, en el puesto 22 de Segunda División. EL NUEVO PARQUE En marzo de 2026 está prevista la reapertura del Parque de Atracciones, teniendo de plazo hasta 2027 para la reforma completa.",

Nothing beats a freshly fried, crispy potato latke dolloped with vegan sour cream. And this recipe is so easy! What you need: 1½ pounds russet potatoes 1 small yellow onion 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley ¼ cup flour ½ teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Safflower oil, for frying What you do: Peel and grate potatoes, and then place in a colander and set over a large bowl. Using your hands, squeeze out excess liquid from potatoes. Pour off liquid and place potatoes in bowl. Grate onion and add to potatoes along with parsley, flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well. Preheat oven to 275 degrees. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat a thin layer of oil. Take a heaping tablespoon of batter and flatten before gently placing in hot oil. Make three or four more potato pancakes this way, and add to skillet without crowding pan. Fry until golden brown on both sides, turning once, about 8 minutes total. Repeat with remaining potato mixture, adding more oil as necessary. Remove cooked potato pancakes to paper towels to drain, then transfer to an ovenproof platter and keep warm in oven until all pancakes are cooked.",

            "content": "The new Now You See Me movie recently wrapped up its third full weekend in theaters, and despite the arrival of newer flicks, it has continued its run as a massive box office success story. At the time of writing, Now You See Me: Now You Don’t has grossed $42. 6 million at the domestic box office and $109. 4 million internationally for a worldwide total of $152 million. This $42 million in America is enough to push Now You See Me 3 past the total domestic haul of The Long Walk, the critically acclaimed Stephen King adaptation that released earlier this year. While Now You See Me: Now You Don’t hasn't been a critical darling by any means, audiences are enjoying the film enough to come out and see it before it leaves theaters. It currently sits at a lukewarm 61% from critics on the aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, but an 81% on the audience-driven Popcornmeter. Directed by Ruben Fleischer and with a script from Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Michael Lesslie, Seth Grahame-Smith, and Eric Warren Singer, the film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and more. It’s expected to be in theaters for a few more weeks before it arrives on digital. As for The Long Walk, not only is it the best Stephen King movie of 2025, it’s one of the best movies of the year. With a Certified Fresh 88% from critics and an 85% from audiences, it’s been hailed as an adaptation that may even be better than the source material. There isn’t quite as much established power behind the film, though, as it found its leads in rising stars David Jonsson (Alien: Romulus) and Cooper Hoffman (Licorice Pizza). When Does 'Now You See Me 3' Begin Streaming? Lionsgate has yet to announce when Now You See Me: Now You Don’t will begin streaming, or even which platform it will air on upon its streaming debut. Lionsgate’s primary streaming outlet is Starz, where it will likely land when it does begin streaming, but it could also be coming to Netflix or HBO Max sometime after. The first two Now You See Me movies are only available on MovieSphere by Lionsgate. The most likely timeline for Now You See Me 3’s streaming debut is sometime early next year, as it will have a few weeks of VOD exclusivity before it begins streaming. Stay tuned to Collider for more box office updates and coverage of Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.",

Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper and San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation to discuss California's diversion model and how defendants charged with felony child abuse, carjackings, residential burglaries and attempted murders can walk free without ever entering a guilty plea.

Herencia (Ciudad Real), 1 de diciembre de 2025. El delegado de Bienestar Social en la provincia de Ciudad Real, Eulalio Díaz-Cano, ha participado hoy en el acto oficial organizado por el Ayuntamiento de Herencia con motivo del Día Internacional de la Discapacidad para reivindicar la defensa de derechos de las personas con discapacidad. Díaz-Cano ha felicitado a este municipio en nombre del Gobierno que preside Emiliano García-Page por el 20 aniversario de su centro ocupacional y de la residencia especializada en la atención de las personas con discapacidad. “Nuestro agradecimiento a las entidades, trabajadores y al Ayuntamiento de Herencia por realizar el esfuerzo que realizan de forma coordinada con la Junta de Comunidades para poner en marcha estos servicios, así como a las personas voluntarias”. El delegado provincial de Bienestar Social ha recordado que la inversión del Gobierno de Castilla-La Mancha en políticas de discapacidad en este municipio supera los 700. 000 euros a través de diferentes recursos, como son el centro ocupacional, el centro de día que atiende a seis personas, el centro ocupacional ‘El Picazuelo’ y la Residencia Carpe Diem, con una capacidad para 30 personas. Por último, Díaz-Cano ha dejado una reflexión en torno a la conmemoración también esta semana del aniversario de la Constitución Española, “una ley fundamental que consagra el principio de igualdad a pesar de que todas las personas somos diferentes y pensamos de forma diferente, algo en lo que trabajamos día a día con el objetivo de garantizar ese derecho”.",

            "content": "As AI gets smarter, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that humans can't rely on their brains alone to succeed at work. In a recent conversation with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner, Nadella said he agrees that emotional intelligence, or EQ, is becoming increasingly important at work as AI handles more technical tasks. Axel Springer is Business Insider's parent company. \"IQ has a place, but it's not the only thing that's needed in the world,\" Nadella said on an episode of Döpfner's \"MD Meets\" podcast that aired November 29. \"I've always felt, at least leaders, if you just have IQ without EQ, it's just a waste of IQ.\" Nadella added that social intelligence is also key, and has previously said that empathy is an important business skill, not just a soft skill. Döpfner also asked whether the importance of empathy is part of why Microsoft is calling more people back to the office, starting early next year. Nadella said that, in the age of AI, it's even more important to recognize the role of human collaboration, and that the workplace is \"the best collaboration tool.\" He added, however, that he doesn't want to be \"dogmatic\" about RTO mandates. Nadella has recently reshuffled Microsoft's leadership team in part to better compete in the AI race, according to documents reviewed by Business Insider. He also tapped Rolf Harms, who helped Microsoft on its journey to cloud-computing success, to serve as an advisor on AI economics, according to a memo Nadella sent in November. With its new superintelligence team, Microsoft is pursuing artificial general intelligence, or technology capable of outperforming humans on a range of complex tasks. Microsoft has laid off thousands of people this year, as the company has increased its scrutiny of employees' performance. A spokesperson previously told Business Insider that most of the cuts weren't based on performance, but instead aimed to streamline operations.",

            "content": "Tania Nemer is one of dozens of immigration judges fired by the Trump administration this year. But a new lawsuit filed in Washington, D. C., suggests what happened to Nemer-and why-has the potential to scramble the federal workforce and upend foundational civil rights laws. Nemer alleges that despite top performance reviews, she was dismissed from her job because of her gender, her status as a dual citizen of Lebanon, and the fact that she once ran for municipal office in Ohio as a Democrat. Those reasons, she says, are all in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the First Amendment. The government has responded by arguing the president's power to oversee the executive branch under Article II of the U. S. Constitution essentially overrides that core civil rights law, Nemer's attorney said. \"This is a case in which the President of the United States has asserted a constitutional right to discriminate against federal employees,\" wrote her lawyer, Nathaniel Zelinsky, of the Washington Litigation Group. \"If the government prevails in transforming the law, it will eviscerate the professional, non-partisan civil service as we know it.\" The administration abruptly fired Nemer in early February, summoning her from the bench and escorting her out of a federal building in Cleveland. Both her supervisor and the chief immigration judge there told her they didn't know why she was being dismissed in the middle of her probationary period, the lawsuit said. Federal workers on probationary status have fewer rights to contest their firing than other civil servants do, but they are still covered by constitutional protections barring retaliation for their political speech; and by civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and national origin. Nemer filed a formal discrimination complaint with an Equal Employment Opportunity office a month after she was fired. That office dismissed her claims in September, asserting in its decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act conflicts with the president's power to remove federal workers within the executive branch. The implications sweep far beyond a single immigration judge, the new lawsuit said. \"According to the final agency decision, the President may now fire female federal workers like Ms. Nemer-because of their sex-and the law would have nothing to say about it,\" according to the new lawsuit. \"According to the final agency decision, the President can now fire federal workers born to immigrant parents with dual citizenship like Ms. Nemer-because of their national origin-and they would have no recourse. And under the same logic, the President can fire federal workers like Ms. Nemer-because of their political activities and affiliations-and the courts would be powerless to act.\" Nemer is seeking reinstatement, backpay and an order erasing her termination. She said she never got official notice about any reasons for her dismissal. But her lawsuit pointed out that in the administrative process, a senior Justice Department immigration official mentioned driving offenses from the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as two local tax cases Nemer had disclosed as part of a background check to become an immigration judge-issues her lawsuit casts as a \"pretext.\".",

Streamingdienste wie Netflix setzen RTL im TV-Geschäft zu. Nun drohen Entlassungen beim Medienkonzern. Die TV-Sendergruppe RTL plant einem Bericht zufolge einen größeren Stellenabbau in Deutschland. Das zum Medienkonzern Bertelsmann gehörende Unternehmen wolle zwischen 800 und 1000 Beschäftigte abbauen, berichtete das Magazin \"Wirtschaftswoche\" am Montag. Die Pläne beträfen die gesamte Sendergruppe, zu der neben dem Stammhaus RTL unter anderem auch der Sender Vox, der Nachrichtensender n-tv und der Streamingdienst RTL+ gehören. Die Sender leiden seit Jahren unter dem schwachen Werbemarkt und der Konkurrenz durch US-Streamingdienste wie Netflix. Mehrere Teilbetriebe von RTL würden eingestellt, dort komme es zu betriebsbedingten Kündigungen. \"Dem Vernehmen nach\" habe die Geschäftsleitung mit dem Betriebsrat einen Sozialplan für den Stellenabbau ausgehandelt, so der Bericht. Die Belegschaft soll am Dienstag informiert werden. Von RTL war zunächst kein Kommentar zu erhalten. Der \"Wirtschaftswoche\" sagte eine Sprecherin: \"Wir bitten um Verständnis, dass wir uns zu Spekulationen grundsätzlich nicht äußern.\" Bertelsmann hatte sich zuletzt von seinen Print-Titeln getrennt und nur das Flaggschiff \"stern\" im Konzern behalten. Zugleich investierte der Konzern im TV-Geschäft und kündigte im Juni die Übernahme von Sky Deutschland an. Erst im November wurde im Konzern die Nachfolge des langjährigen Konzernchefs Thomas Rabe geklärt. Ihm folgt ab 1. Januar 2027 Thomas Coesfeld. Der 35-Jährige ist damit der erste Chef aus dem Kreis der Bertelsmann-Familie seit 1981. Coesfeld ist der Enkel des 2009 verstorbenen Firmenpatriarchen Reinhard Mohn, der das Gütersloher Unternehmen von 1947 an über mehr als drei Jahrzehnte steuerte.",

            "content": "El Gobierno de Aragón continúa buscando un impulso decidido a las políticas de vivienda. Este lunes el Boletín Oficial de Aragón (BOA) publica la resolución provisional de subvenciones para rehabilitar 185 viviendas más en 94 pueblos de Aragón, correspondiente a la segunda convocatoria del Programa 700, dotada de 10 millones de euros. Así lo ha anunciado hoy el consejero de Fomento, Vivienda, Logística y Cohesión Territorial, Octavio López, durante la visita a una vivienda rehabilitada con el citado programa en la localidad turolense de Celadas. Tal como ha explicado el responsable de Vivienda del Gobierno autonómico, se trata de “ayudas de entre 50. 000 y 66. 000 euros por vivienda rehabilitada a las que pueden optar los 700 municipios más pequeños de Aragón y que sumarán un montante de 52, 5 millones de euros a lo largo de los seis años de aplicación del programa, gracias a los cuales se prevé la promoción de unas 800 viviendas públicas a lo largo y ancho del territorio en el medio rural aragonés”. Siguiendo las bases de la convocatoria publicada el 19 de agosto de 2024, los municipios que ahora se ven beneficiados son los que pasaron a formar parte de una lista de reserva ordenada en base a la puntuación obtenida entonces, según la cual se estableció un orden de prelación de cara a una siguiente tanda de ayudas, sin tener que cumplir más requisitos que el de manifestar su voluntad de acceder a la subvención, sin que haya sido preciso volver a presentar la documentación exigida. 10 MILLONES EN AYUDAS “La cuantía de esta segunda fase de ayudas asciende a 10 millones de euros y los destinatarios de la misma son 94 municipios que se presentaron a la primera convocatoria en concurrencia competitiva, que cumplían los requisitos, entre ellos la capacidad de aportar suelo apto para la construcción de viviendas o edificaciones preexistentes que puedan ser rehabilitadas, y que se quedaron sin las ayudas por agotarse el crédito presupuestario”, ha explicado Octavio López. La cuantía total de esta segunda convocatoria se va a distribuir de la siguiente manera: 6 millones en el presente ejercicio, un millón en 2026 y 3 millones en 2027. La presentación de esta segunda convocatoria del Programa 700 se ha realizado en el municipio turolense de Celadas, de poco más de 300 habitantes, perteneciente a la comarca de la Comunidad de Teruel, donde el Ayuntamiento ha recibido subvención en esta segunda convocatoria del Programa 700 de 126. 000 euros para rehabilitar dos viviendas. El consejero Octavio López, acompañado de la alcaldesa, Raquel Clemente, ha visitado la primera de las obras que se está llevando a cabo para poner la primera de las dos viviendas al servicio de la ciudadanía. “Esta es la manera que tiene el Gobierno de Jorge Azcón de enfrentar el principal problema que hoy tienen los ciudadanos españoles y aragoneses, construyendo y rehabilitando vivienda pública allá donde se necesita, bien sea una gran capital, un municipio mediano, uno turístico o un pequeño pueblo de la provincia de Teruel, como es Celadas, en el que hacer una o dos viviendas puede suponer un pequeño pero decisivo paso para dar oportunidades a ese joven que se quiere quedar a vivir aquí o a es ese nuevo poblador que estaría dispuesto a fijar su vida en este lugar y no pueden por la falta de vivienda”. López ha destacado que a esta segunda convocatoria del Programa 700 se han presentado más de 200 solicitudes, prácticamente un tercio de los municipios, lo que, a juicio del consejero, demuestra “un gran éxito de un programa ideado por la Consejería que anteriormente no existía”. Por su parte, la regidora de Celadas, Raquel Clemente, ha agradecido al Gobierno de Aragón \"que sea capaz de tener esa sensibilidad hacia los pueblos y haber hecho este Programa 700 enfocado al medio rural, porque yo creo que es la primera vez que hemos tenido un programa con estas cuantías para ayudarnos en el mayor problema que tenemos en el medio rural, que es la vivienda\". En relación a las viviendas que se están rehabilitando, Clemente ha explicado que son pisos de dos habitaciones, un salón comedor y una cocina, pensados para que los jóvenes puedan iniciar una nueva etapa en la vida con una cuota de alquiler asequible de 200 euros al mes.

            "content": "Burnley will host Crystal Palace at Turf Moor on Wednesday in another round of the 2025-26 Premier League campaign. The home side endured a difficult November, losing all four of their matches in the month, and will be aiming for a stronger finish to the year as they sit 19th in the table with 10 points. They fell 3-1 to Brentford at the weekend and had looked on course to secure a point on hostile ground after Zian Flemming’s 85th-minute penalty brought them level, only for Brentford to score twice late on to reclaim the lead and cart away all three points. Thanks for the submission! Crystal Palace, meanwhile, hosted a floundering Manchester United side at Selhurst Park on Sunday with hopes of extending their strong league form and appeared well on course to do so after talisman Jean-Philippe Mateta put the Eagles ahead from the penalty spot in the first half. However, they faltered after the break, conceding twice in nine minutes to lose 2-1 and suffer their first home defeat to United since 2020. Sunday's defeat came just three days after Palace’s 2-1 loss to Strasbourg in Europe and they will be eager to halt the slump and quickly restart a positive run of results. Burnley vs Crystal Palace Head-to-Head and Key Numbers There have been 55 meetings between the two clubs. Burnley hold the upper hand in this fixture with 21 wins to Palace's 15, while their other 19 contests have ended level. The two teams last faced off in the 2023-24 Premier League campaign, with Palace winning both the home and away fixtures. Burnley have conceded 27 goals in the league this season. Only last-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers (28) have shipped more. Palace, meanwhile, have conceded 11 times in the Premier League this season. Only league leaders Arsenal (7) have conceded fewer. Burnley vs Crystal Palace Prediction The Clarets are on a four-game losing streak and have lost seven of their last nine. They are underdogs heading into this one but will look to make the most of their home advantage to perhaps secure a point. The Eagles have lost their last two games after going undefeated in their previous five. They have been inconsistent on the road recently but remain the stronger side ahead of Wednesday's game and should win this one. Prediction: Burnley 0-1 Crystal Palace Burnley vs Crystal Palace Betting Tips Tip 1 Result: Palace to win Tip 2 Goals Over/under 2. 5 Under 2. 5 goals (Four of the Eagles' last five league matches have produced fewer than 2. 5 goals) Tip 3 Both teams to score: No.",

Losses against the Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos would be enough to end the team's season, despite beating the formidable Philadelphia Eagles. #4 Kansas City Chiefs The Kansas City Chiefs could finish in ninth place in the AFC and miss the playoffs with a 9-8 record. Winning against the Houston Texans, Los Angeles Chargers, and Las Vegas Raiders would not be enough to reach January. It would be enough to keep the team's streak of winning seasons alive, but not much more than that. #3 Dallas Cowboys The Dallas Cowboys have found a new gear in recent weeks, but the season could still end disappointingly at 8-8-1 and out of the playoff race. A Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions and losses against the Los Angeles Chargers and Washington Commanders would be enough to keep the team out of the top seven. As such, they would be out of the playoff race. #2 Baltimore Ravens The Baltimore Ravens managed to salvage a division race out of a lifeless start to the year, but they can still finish under . 500 and miss the playoffs at 8-9. The Ravens could lose to the Pittsburgh Steelers twice and the Green Bay Packers to slip out of the running and finish as the tenth seed, three spots out of the running. #1 Carolina Panthers The Carolina Panthers are flying high after upsetting the Los Angeles Rams in Week 13, but the season could still end in anticlimactic fashion. Carolina can end up 9-8 and miss the playoffs as the ninth seed if they lose to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks in the final stretch of the season.",

Of course, with many players having run out their welcome this season, you might be looking for some inspiration on who you can trust in what could be the biggest game yet of the year. Luckily, Sportskeeda has compiled this handy list of players to avoid and start. The lists take into account various factors, but aim to list only players with a high likelihood of spiking or flatlining this week. Without further ado, here's who should start and sit in Week 14 of fantasy football. Thanks for the submission!

Expect Stafford to get back into form against the Arizona Cardinals, a team that hasn't managed to shut down much in recent weeks. Bucky Irving is back on the field after a long wait, and he didn't waste time producing. As such, managers should feel confident about leaning on the back heading into Week 14. James Cook faces the Cincinnati Bengals defense in Week 14, and that means significant fantasy points for managers after Cook ripped off two straight 100-yard performances, earning 144 yards against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.

It could be a lingering injury, with the quarterback routinely appearing on the Baltimore Ravens' official injury report. Regardless, managers need to look elsewhere for the rest of the season. Marvin Harrison Jr. returned to the fold in Week 13, which means the Michael Wilson experiment is likely over. He might be worth keeping, but not worth starting except in desperate circumstances. Terry McLaurin is back and finally turned in a WR1-caliber fantasy football performance. However, the Washington Commanders will travel to face the Minnesota Vikings in their building, and after an exhausting overtime game on Sunday, don't expect a duplicate performance from the receiver who has been out of sorts for most of the year.

            "content": "Serena Williams is rumored to make a sensational return to professional tennis. Her name has appeared again on the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA)’s International Registered Testing Pool (IRTP). Although the American is still listed as retired (2022), the ITIA rules state that players must be available for at least six months of testing before returning to tournaments. This could suggest that she may come back to the tour in 2026 or 2027. Thanks for the submission! Williams is one of the most decorated athletes in the history of women's tennis. She captured 23 Grand Slam titles and four Olympic Gold medals during her career. Williams being added to the IRTP isn’t the first sign she might return. The 44-year-old had openly shared her plans during a TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco in 2022. “I am not retired. The chances of me returning are very high. You can come to my house and see that I have a court. I still haven’t really thought about it,\" Serena Williams said \"I did go on the court the other day and [realised] for the first time in my life that I’m not playing for a competition and that felt very weird. It was like the first day of the rest of my life, and so far, I am enjoying it. But I’m still trying to find that balance,” She added Williams is often seen spending time with her family or focusing on her business ventures. She has also worked hard on her fitness, losing nearly 17 kg this year. \"I challenge her to come back next year\" Novak Djokovic misses Serena Williams' competitive spirit on tour Novak Djokovic is still competing at a high level on the ATP Tour. At 38, he reached the semifinals of all four Majors and also won the Hellenic Championships this year. The Serb enjoyed watching Serena Williams introduce her longtime rival Maria Sharapova at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. He described the moment as gracious and also lightheartedly invited Williams to make a comeback to the tour. “Seeing Serena, you know, in any shape or form around tennis is great. You know, we miss her. And she still hasn’t officially retired, so I invite her. I challenge her because she’s such a great competitor. So when somebody challenges her, she never refuses. So I challenge Serena. Come back on a Tour next year,\" Novak Djokovic said after winning the first round at the US Open Williams dominated the head-to-head battle against Sharapova 20-2. She defeated the Russian in straight sets during their last match at the 2022 US Open. Serena’s sister, Venus Williams, is still competing on the WTA Tour. She reached the quarterfinals of the US Open doubles tournament this year, partnering with Leylah Fernandez. Williams has yet to give an official update on her return to professional tennis. The American has been spotted at select events, watching some significant matches this year.",

            "content": "The recent dev diary for Pantheon Rise of the Fallen highlights everything new coming in the December 2025 update. This time, it’s focused on mounts and the taming system, providing players with an easy way to travel around. However, that’s not all, as there is a deeper progression within, allowing you to tame and trade a variety of mounts. With this update, the devs aim to lay the foundation for the mount system, providing players with something new to grind for. The future update promises the ability to name, gear, or trade mounts, but let’s find out more about what's coming in the initial mounts and taming update for Pantheon Rise of the Fallen. Everything new coming in Pantheon Rise of the Fallen’s December update Mounts With the December update, you’ll be able to tame a variety of creatures in the game and convert them into mounts. Most games feature them as a means of traveling, but in Pantheon Rise of the Fallen, mounts come in different rarities and stat spreads. Taming is a new ability that will help you capture mounts. You’ll get it as part of an introductory quest after reaching at least level 20 to gain access. You can use the ability once you're close enough to the mount. However, there are several steps to complete the process. The skill consumes Endurance, so investing in that stat will make the process much easier. Creatures also have ‘Will’ that increases taming cost. Higher rarity creatures also have a higher amount of Will, making the process a lot more tedious. Additionally, during the process, the creature will become hostile and will attack the tamer, meaning you’ll also need to improve your HP and defense to survive the next ten seconds. Stables Stables are where you register your mount. The process is necessary to permanently own your mounts, as even after taming, you can lose them due to various reasons. Once you tame a creature, ride it to the nearest stable within the villages or towns. This process is necessary, as teleporting directly before reaching the stable will result in you losing the mount. Note that you can take an unregistered mount into an adjacent zone, but you can lose it if it takes too much damage or you are forcibly dismounted. Luckily, stables are available everywhere. They also let you keep track of and manage all your mounts. Additionally, you can also pay a small fee to return a registered mount to the stable while traveling in the open world. This feature will be useful if you find a higher rarity creature, as you can only have one active mount on the field. Check out other related guides and features:.",

            "pub_date": "2025-12-01T17:02:00",
            "creator": "ZDNET",
            "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. Capturing great photography has gotten easier and easier these days, thanks to the trusty smartphones we all carry in our pockets. However, there are times when a smartphone's capabilities will not be sufficient. Instead, opt for a dedicated, pro-grade camera, such as the Nikon Z5 II. No need to lean on AI smarts or computational photography, just lean on the right tool for the right job. Also: Cyber Monday deals are huge in 2025: Shop my favorite deals from Amazon, Best Buy, Lowe's & more The team at Nikon was kind enough to loan me its Z5 II for a couple of weeks to see just how well its mid-tier camera body will hold up for day-to-day photography as well as professional scenarios. It's been a lot of fun trying out the Z5 II. Allow me to share my experience with you. The basics you should know The Nikon Z5 II is a 24. 5-megapixel full-frame camera capable of grabbing images at 14 frames per second while using the mechanical shutter. But this is the age of mirrorless cameras. Photographers can now shoot with an electronic shutter. The Z5 II allows for 30 frames per second capture in electronic shutter mode. Making it extremely easy to capture action shots. The Z5 II also captures video in 4K up to 60 frames per second and HD resolution at 120 frames per second. It also includes dual SD card slots for those days when the photoshoot runs really long. Using the Z5 II on a professional job Granted I spend most of my time in front of the camera more so this year than behind the it, but from time to time I still shoot high school sports and portraits. I tried the Z5 II in a portrait environment, then really challenged it in not only a sports environment, but a low-light, fast-paced football game. Shooting with controlled lighting in a studio setting was a breeze, as is the case with most cameras these days. As someone who's accustomed to shooting in manual mode, I encountered no problems adjusting the shutter speed, ISO, or aperture on the Z5 II because the dials and controls are well-positioned to work with almost anyone holding the camera body. Also: I fell in love with a $2,000 mirrorless camera that puts design and simplicity over everything else I'm a Canon shooter because the ergonomics on Canon bodies best fit my large hands, but this offering from Nikon is a worthy mention in terms of ergonomics, in addition to its image quality. While shooting a football game, I knew the Z5 II would be challenged. A few variables were stacked against it. First, the football field was poorly lit for photography at higher shutter speeds. Secondly, Nikon loaned me its 24-50mm \"kit\" lens. This has lower-quality glass as well as a less-than-ideal aperture at f/6. 3. Due to these variables, the ISO had to be set higher than 6400 to capture any usable frames. Having an ISO above 1600 can lead to image noise if the camera isn't properly stabilized during image capture. With that said, the images from the Z5 II weren't bad. I wish I could have utilized a tighter focal length, but the images were definitely usable. The image noise was low. The quality was strong. The autofocus was outstanding. Football players running the ball present a lot of challenges. First, they're moving really quickly -- toward you. Also: Microsoft's new AI agents create your Word, Excel, and PowerPoint projects now Secondly, the lighting is usually low. From the camera settings, you'll need a shutter speed that's fast enough to limit motion blur and an autofocus that will keep up with the subject as it moves quickly into and through your framing. As you can see in the image sequence, the Z5 II maintained great focus on the runner with the football and exhibited minimal motion blur, even at a 1/250-second shutter speed. The runner ran past me and was still in focus. Again, I wish I had a more professional lens attached to this camera body, but this was a fun attempt. Some may notice how green the grass looks in this image. This is not due to the color science of the Z5 II. The grass is truly that green this time of year in Northern California. ZDNET's buying advice The Nikon Z5 II mirrorless camera body is available online for $1,596. You can add the kit lens for a total of $1,896. This is a fair price. Even though you're paying for a photography kit that's roughly the same price as your trusty smartphone, it doesn't even send text messages. What you lack in telephony capability, you gain in true photography prowess. The full-frame sensor will perform significantly better than your smartphone, both in low-light and well-lit conditions. You'll get a true 24. 5-megapixel image with vibrant colors. Not faux \"40-megapixels\" offered by smartphones due to pixel binning. My only criticism of the Z5 II is that the image sensor isn't protected when changing lenses. Ideally, a shutter curtain should cover the sensor when it's not in use. That's not the case with this camera body. I would recommend this camera to photography enthusiasts looking to expand their photography portfolio and take on serious professional work. Just add a prime lens to the Z-mount and start shooting.",

            "content": "Pünktlich zum Weihnachtsgeschäft hat Perodua aus Malaysia am Montag sein erstes Elektroauto QV-E auf den Markt gebracht, das ab 80. 000 Ringgit (rund 16. 740 Euro) kosten soll. Die Botschaft ist klar: E-Mobilität soll für die Mittelschicht funktionieren. Eine Besonderheit ist, dass die Batterie separat geleast wird nach dem Prinzip \"Battery as a Service\". Die Leasingkosten kommen also noch dazu, der große Vorteil ist aber die enorme Schnelligkeit, mit der die Akkus ausgetauscht werden (3-5 Minuten) und, dass sich Käufer nie wieder um das Thema kümmern müssen. Sie werden für die gesamte Laufzeit des Fahrzeugs zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Kunden zahlen weniger in der Anschaffung, erhalten eine Batterie mit bis zu 445 Kilometern Reichweite und müssen sich um Alterung oder Restwert kaum sorgen. Der Batterietausch boomt in Asien längst im Massenmarkt. In China betreiben Hersteller wie NIO, SAIC und Geely und Energieunternehmen ein dichtes Netz an Wechselstationen, das täglich zehntausende Fahrzeuge bedient. NIO hat den Vorgang des Batterietauschs nahezu perfektioniert und macht ihn in drei bis fünf Minuten möglich. Auch in Taiwan funktioniert das Modell allerdings im Zweiradsegment: Dort tauschen Hunderttausende Rollerfahrer ihre Akkus an rund um die Uhr geöffneten Stationen. In Indien wiederum entsteht ein eigenes Ökosystem für austauschbare Batterien bei Tuk-Tuks, Lieferfahrzeugen und Low-Cost-E-Scootern. Kurz: In großen Teilen Asiens ist Battery Swapping keine Zukunftsvision mehr, sondern Alltag. Lesen Sie auch wallstreetONLINE RedaktionBis 1. 500 km Reichweite Deutsche Autobauer verschlafen schon wieder Mega-Trend! Volkswagen, BMW und Mercedes-Benz haben bislang kein einziges Serienmodell mit Akkuwechsel angekündigt. Es gibt weder technische Plattformen dafür noch Infrastrukturpläne, geschweige denn Kooperationen. Während chinesische Anbieter ihre Swap-Stationen sogar anderen Herstellern öffnen, halten die deutschen Marken am klassischen Konzept fest: Schnellladen statt Tauschen, Eigentumsbatterie statt Abo-Modell. Von \"Technologieoffenheit\" keine Spur. Auch mit Blick auf die Erschwinglichkeit der E-Autos geht Deutschland andere Wege. Die quasi parallel zu Perodua vorgestellten Modelle umfassen den BMW iX3 Neue Klasse (Grundpreis 68. 900 Euro), den Audi A6 e-tron (ab 77. 250 Euro) und den Porsche Macan Electric (ab 80. 700 Euro). Dass die Konzentration auf die Wohlhabendsten auf Dauer nicht gut gehen kann, hätte eigentlich klar sein müssen. Immerhin gab es zuletzt erste Anzeichen für ein Umdenken. Mercedes verabschiedete sich kürzlich von seiner Luxus-Strategie. Und Volkswagen kündigte für 2026 den ID. 2all an, der unter 25. 000 Euro kosten soll. Im Jahr darauf soll unter Umständen dann ein ID. 1 herauskommen, der weniger als 20. 000 Euro kostet. Spät, aber hoffentlich nicht zu spät. Dass die deutschen Hersteller beim Batterietausch nicht mitspielen, hat auch strukturelle Gründe. Zunächst fehlt ihnen die technische Standardisierung, die Swapping überhaupt erst sinnvoll macht. Deutsche Fahrzeugplattformen sind vielfältig, Batterien unterschiedlich verbaut, die Designs zu ausdifferenziert, um ein einheitliches Wechselmodul einzuführen. Darüber hinaus scheuen die Autobauer die Investitionen in ein eigenes Tauschnetz, denn dafür wären große Vorleistungen nötig und das in einem Markt, der in Europa noch völlig unerschlossen ist. Hinzu kommt ein geschäftspolitischer Aspekt: Die Batterie ist heute ein zentraler Werttreiber im Auto. Würde sie aus dem Produkt herausgelöst und in ein Miet- oder Abo-Modell überführt, verlören die Fahrzeugbauer einen Teil ihrer Marge an Infrastrukturanbieter. Und schließlich steckt hinter der Zurückhaltung auch ein Stück Markenidentität: Die deutsche Autoindustrie hat sich jahrelang über Premium, Reichweite und hochpreisige Modelle definiert. Ein Konzept wie Battery Swapping wirkt dagegen pragmatisch, kostensensibel und stark auf den Massenmarkt ausgerichtet genau der Bereich, den deutsche Autokonzerne lange vernachlässigt haben. Während in Asien also erschwingliche E-Autos mit Akku-Abo und schnellem Tausch zur Normalität werden, klammern sich deutsche Hersteller an das Ideal des technisch aufgeladenen Oberklasseprodukts. Der Fehler ist bekannt: Wer nur nach oben denkt, übersieht den Massenmarkt von unten. Aber genau dort entscheidet sich, wie die Mobilität der Zukunft wirklich aussieht.

            "content": "ZDFheute: Welchen Effekt hat es auf die Bürgerinnen und Bürger, wenn sie in einer armen Kommune leben? Stefan Marschall: Wir wissen, dass sich die Menschen sehr stark mit ihrer Kommune identifizieren, und wenn es dort Probleme gibt, hat das Auswirkungen auf ihre Gesamthaltung zum Staat und der eigenen Heimat. Es ist also so, dass das, was man als staatliche Leistung bezeichnet, zuallererst auf kommunaler Ebene wahrgenommen wird. ZDFheute: Unterscheiden die Menschen denn überhaupt zwischen den Ebenen Bundes-, Landes- und Kommunalpolitik? Marschall: Eher nicht, für die Menschen ist nicht entscheidend, wer zuständig ist, das ist eher eine rechtliche Frage. Den Menschen ist es egal, ob der Bund, das Land oder ihre Kommune zuständig sind. Für sie ist einfach wichtig, dass der Staat leistungsfähig ist. Tübingens Oberbürgermeister Boris Palmer: \"Kommunen fahren gegen die Wand\" . ist Professor für Politikwissenschaft an der Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf mit dem Schwerpunkt \"Politisches System Deutschlands\". Quelle: HHU Düsseldorf ZDFheute: Wenn also in meiner Kommune Straßen oder Schulen dauerhaft marode sind, ändert das mein grundsätzliches Verhältnis zum Staat? Marschall: Wenn die Menschen denken, die Politik kümmert sich nicht, dann zweifeln diese Menschen häufig insgesamt an der staatlichen Leistungsfähigkeit. ZDFheute: Gibt es ein Ungerechtigkeitsempfinden bei den Menschen, wenn sie sehen in meiner Kommune sind Gebühren und Abgaben höher als in den Nachbarkommunen? Marschall: Die Menschen beobachten schon sehr genau, was in anderen Kommunen passiert. Viele kennen ja Leute aus den Nachbarkommunen und man kann die Abgaben und Gebühren ja sehr gut vergleichen. Und so kann ein deutlicher Eindruck entstehen, wenn man merkt, in der einen Kommune werden bestimmte Leistungen nicht mehr erbracht, zum Beispiel Schwimmbäder oder Bibliotheken schließen. Diese Vergleiche können dazu führen, dass Frustration entsteht. Schwimmbad-Sanierung: Wer zahlt die Kosten? Kommunen in Finanznot: Wo das Geld dringend nötig ist ZDFheute: Viele Kommunen sind ja enorm hoch verschuldet. Ist es durch Sparen eigentlich möglich, wieder auf einen grünen Zweig zu kommen? Marschall: Die Verschuldung ist in vielen Kommunen so massiv, die Spielräume sind völlig eingeschränkt. Das führt dazu, dass Kommunalpolitiker vielerorts eigentlich kaum noch Spielräume haben. Oft ist es so, dass nur noch die Pflichtaufgaben erfüllt werden können, es ist eine Art Mangelverwaltung. Finanzreport: Kommunen rutschen ins Rekordminus Am Ende geht es auf der kommunalen Ebene dann nur noch um Notverwaltung, nicht mehr um Gestaltung.",

            "content": "By WILLIAM CLARK Residents and Monmouth University students gathered on the Long Branch beach recently to etch a 156-foot sand art message aimed at raising awareness of how land thousands of miles away impacts New Jersey. Jackson Smith of the Alaskan Wilderness League led efforts to push awareness of protecting land in the arctic. “It’s one of the last truly wild places,” Smith said. “It’s roughly the size of South Carolina.” The refuge is home to polar bears, caribou and holds migratory birds that come to New Jersey. The refuge is also the land of native tribes. Smith said any changes to the arctic environment speeds up climate change worldwide. Conservation efforts and protective status does not just help Alaska but everyone, Smith said. The art on the beach helped draw people into the group’s efforts to sign and spread petitions and raise awareness of the cause. Long Branch, just on the edge of Representative Chris Smith’s district, was an ideal place for the exercise, Smith said. Although Smith is a Republican, the effort to protect spaces crosses party lines, Jackson Smith said. “The arctic is too precious to drill,” the organizer said. For an hour and a half, volunteers etched the words into the sand while volunteers spoke with people passing by, urging them to join the actions the group has facilitated. Smith said the group received extensive appreciation for their effort from those they spoke to. The sand message was a new medium to get the word out. The first time endeavor was successful, Smith said. Over the span they used small shovels and other basic tools to ensure it was straight and mostly in a shared style. Overhead shots taken with a drone allowed for the best perspective. Smith said Long Branch is just one of many efforts that take place around New Jersey and the country. They have linked up with the Audubon Society and Sierra Club chapters to reach as wide an audience as possible. More information on the organization and ways to help support the cause can be found on defendthearctic. org. “It’s a no brainer,” Smith said. “There’s not really a downside.”.",

Prairie Farms is recalling some of its fat-free milk products that may be contaminated with a food-grade cleaning agent, which can lead to illness, according to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The recall affects Prairie Farms Gallon Fat Free Milk, produced at the company's Dubuque, Iowa, facility, and distributed to Woodman's stores in Illinois and Wisconsin. Per the FDA, only a specific segment of the December 8 production run was impacted. To identify the product, look for a DEC08 code date and PLT19-145 plant code. The containers also have a timestamp of between 17: 51 and 21: 23 and UPC 7273023117. The company was made aware of the potential quality concern on November 24. An investigation was initiated as soon as the issue was brought to light, and all affected products were removed from store shelves. Although the recalled milk is no longer available for purchase, it may still be in consumers' refrigerators. According to the FDA, approximately 320 gallons of the milk were sold before Prairie Farms discovered the contamination issue. If you purchased the recalled milk, don't consume it. Instead, dispose of it or return it to the store for a refund. com.",

            "content": "RESTON, Va., Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regula, a global developer of forensic devices and identity verification (IDV) solutions, unveils the new Regula 7320 mobile document reader a compact device designed to solve one of the industry’s most persistent challenges: the lack of a reliable, fully autonomous, and seamlessly integrated solution for identity verification outside stationary checkpoints. In the field, verification workflows often remain fragmented. Officers must manually re-enter or transfer data, operate with limited power or connectivity, and rely on tools that do not integrate into centralized systems. All this creates delays, inconsistencies, and security gaps. The new Regula 7320 eliminates these issues by bringing border-grade verification, full autonomy, and native ecosystem integration to any location even without network access. Built for professionals in high-risk and high-security sectors from border control and road police to transport security and regulated industries like gambling or car rental the Regula 7320 performs the full identity verification on the spot. Regula 7320 mobile document reader ensures the most trustworthy identity verification even in remote locations Designed for critical operations The Regula 7320 is a new model of mobile document reader that adds more autonomy, power, and interoperability to support even the most demanding scenarios. With border-grade performance and seamless infrastructure integration, the Regula 7320 enables teams to: Verify in various conditions and locations: Perform full document verification (including RFID reading and validation), facial matching, and fingerprint capture in the field, ensuring high reliability even in remote or restricted zones. This eliminates manual re-entry, enables instant processing of cases, and ensures every identity record is logged and consistent. The result: faster decision-making, fewer errors, and end-to-end automation across the entire identity lifecycle. Build seamless environments: Integrate with existing Regula infrastructure or third-party databases for automated AML (anti-money laundering) or PEP (politically exposed persons) checks, data extraction, and reporting, thus minimizing manual work and complex integrations. Technical excellence The Regula 7320 is built for those who can’t compromise on accuracy or reliability. Its new architecture merges powerful optics, optimized lighting, and extended power capacity to ensure uncompromised verification performance. High-resolution imaging: High-resolution visible-light and 8 MP infrared (IR) cameras deliver forensic-level detail, allowing officers to detect even the smallest traces of forgery or alteration in IDs. Forensic-grade verification accuracy: Optimized UV (ultra-violet) color rendering enables capturing laboratory-grade UV images even under normal ambient light, while a dedicated IR algorithm prevents overexposure and preserves fine detail. These enhancements deliver field-ready automated document authenticity checks comparable to those of a stationary forensic workstation. Extended autonomy: Powered by Regula’s in-house authenticator with an 11, 000 mAh battery, which can be recharged directly from a high-capacity smartphone, the device provides longer runtimes without recharging, which is essential for field operations. Offline resilience: When connectivity is unavailable, all verified data is securely stored on the device and automatically synchronized with central systems once the connection is restored, ensuring continuity and compliance. “The Regula 7320 turns field verification from an isolated task into part of an integrated ecosystem. By merging document, biometric, and data verification into one connected workflow, it enables organizations to cut costs, reduce verification times, and strengthen trust across every touchpoint of the identity lifecycle. This upgrade also empowers organizations to address long-standing challenges like limited mobility, fragmented tools, and complex integrations,” says Alex Lewanowicz, Director of Hardware Engineering at Regula.
