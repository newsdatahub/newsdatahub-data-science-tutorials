He believes that the Brazilian needs to be managed, but can still be a big attraction for the league and the club. Ad Speaking to GOAL, Friedel suggested that Inter Miami should offer Neymar a performance-based contract to ensure they pay him only when he plays. He said the move would help the club and the league, but remains on the fence about it. He said: Thanks for the submission! \"If Neymar is fit, then I think it works, I really do because he’s still a huge name in certain parts of the US. The trouble is if he’s not fit and he’s injured a lot, then it becomes a negative media-driven reality. I can understand arguments on both sides for sure. I would assume, and these are smart guys, it would be a tiered contract based on performances and being fit.\" Ad Trending \"Having spent some time in Miami, before Messi came, you wouldn’t have really known that Miami had a team. From the time that he came, there are pink and black shirts everywhere. If Neymar came, it would add to that. I can understand what they are trying to do. You have to look at it carefully because it’s a tough one due to his injury record. But he has that special talent that can really excite some American fans. He can do some special things. I would probably be 55 for it and 45 against.” Ad Neymar is at the end of his contract at Santos and will be a free agent when the season ends. Lionel Messi has extended his deal at Inter Miami, keeping him at the club until 2028. Lionel Messi unsure about Neymar reunion at Inter Miami Lionel Messi was asked by infobae earlier this year if Neymar should make a move to Inter Miami next season, and the Argentine was quick to suggest that he was unsure. He is unsure if the Brazilian would join the MLS side and said: Ad “I don't know. He went through a difficult year, where he was injured for a long time, which leaves him out of the Copa America as well, where he could not play most of the games in Arabia. And now it's difficult. Afterwards, I don't know, the truth is that life takes so many turns that anything can happen, but I don't think that today, no.” Neymar and Lionel Messi have played 206 matches together at Barcelona and PSG. They have combined for 67 goals in their games together. × Feedback Why did you not like this content?

How dare you tempt me like this, PlayStation, by dropping the price of both special-edition Ghost of Yotei PS5 consoles by $100 in Cyber Monday PS5 deals. I've basically not stopped playing Ghost of Yotei since it came out in October, snatching every free minute I can spare to dive into it's amazing open world with Atsu and her quest for revenge. I'm sorry Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, I love you dearly, but its Ghost of Yotei that takes my award for GOTY this year. If I had any spare cash right now and didn't already have two PS5s, two gaming PCs and numerous other gaming consoles, I would be absolutely buying one of these Ghost of Yotei PS5s. PlayStation Direct has $100 off both the black and gold versions of these stunning limited edition designs, although the gold keeps coming in and out of stock. Should you buy the Limited Edition Ghost of Yotei PS5 console? If you're anything like me and have absolutely fallen in love with both Ghost of Tsushima and now Ghost of Yotei, I honestly believe you deserve one of these. These are both PS5 Slim consoles, complete with disc drive, but with the limited edition designs. At $499, you are essentially paying $50 for the limited edition design. Walmart currently has the standard PS5 Slim for $449, but the usual RRP for the normal slim being $549 and the limited edition ones at $599, this is still an exceptionally good deal for a console design that won't be around forever.

            "content": "D. C. police have started patrolling with the National Guard, a change in the relationship between local and federal officials in the aftermath of last week’s shooting that killed one guard member and left another critically injured. In some instances, officers have already started working directly alongside National Guard members on patrol, according to a D. C. police official who asked not to be named to openly discuss the plans. But it’s unclear how long the pairing will last. D. C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the officers working with the guard members may not last beyond this week, NBC Washington reported. The official told WTOP plans for collaboration moving forward are still in the works, but could come before the end of the week. The D. C. officers who are directly working with the National Guard are working in an overtime capacity, the official said, so they’re not being asked to focus on collaboration with troops at the expense of other day-to-day responsibilities. The D. C. National Guard’s Joint Task Force said in a statement over email that it will continue to work with D. C. police “to ensure the safety of all who live, work, and visit the District.” Through a spokesperson, D. C. Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment on the plans. Last week, The Washington Post first reported plans for D. C. police and the National Guard to patrol together. The step comes days after the shooting near Farragut Square in Downtown D. C. that killed Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, a National Guard member from West Virginia. Officials said Beckstrom died on Thanksgiving Day. Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, meanwhile, is still in the hospital with critical injuries. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is expected to appear in court once he’s medically able, according to U. S. Attorney for D. C. Jeanine Pirro’s office. Lakanwal had been unraveling for years, according to The Associated Press, so much so that a community advocate contacted a refugee organization for assistance, worried that Lakanwal was becoming suicidal. In Afghanistan, Lakanwal worked in a special Afghan Army unit called Zero Unit, backed by the CIA. He came to the U. S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, which resettled Afghans after the American withdrawal. Last week, The Washington Post reported, D. C. police leaders received an email that said officers will “conduct high-visibility patrols with the National Guard and provide assistance as needed.” The message included the caveat that plans for the collaboration were evolving. National Guard members first arrived in D. C. in August as part of President Donald Trump’s crime emergency and law enforcement surge. They’ve largely worked on city streets, in parks and Metro stations, without representatives from other law enforcement agencies. During a news conference Monday, Maj. Gen. James Seward, adjutant general of the West Virginia National Guard, said he could not “go into the details” about future planned operations regarding troops in the District. After Wednesday’s shooting, Trump requested that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth order 500 more National Guard members to D. C.

I'm A Celeb: Ant and Dec broadcast live from the studio *Warning: This article contains spoilers for the latest episode of I'm A Celebrity. Get Me Out of Here!* Monday evening saw ITV presenters Ant and Dec enter the camp to announce the third celebrity departure from the series. The presenting pair confirmed that Vogue would be exiting the jungle following the public vote, requiring her immediate departure from the I'm A Celebrity camp. Following the announcement of Vogue's name, fellow campmates were left heartbroken as they bid farewell before the eliminated star sat down with Ant and Dec to discuss her time in the jungle, reports the Daily Star. Previously, ITV audiences have witnessed the departures of Alex Scott and Eddie Kadi from the programme, causing considerable upset amongst the remaining contestants and viewers. Shortly afterwards, viewers flocked to X to express their reactions to the latest elimination from the programme.

She's a great camper. And yet the British public vote fail again.\" Overall, Vogue spent 13 days in the camp having been amongst the later arrivals alongside Tom Read Wilson. When questioned about leaving the jungle, she responded: \"It feels good I have to say, it was getting really hard and I'm so hungry! But, it's such a weird thing because you kind of want to stay as well. \"It's so fun in there, you're just doing so many random things, everyone is such good fun and I'll be sad to leave.\" Whilst watching clips of her jungle highlights, the 40-year-old disclosed she had overcome her fear of cockroaches following one of the trials. Ant enquired whether she had surprised herself with everything she tackled during her stint. She responded: \"I surprised myself, I think that got to us most was the hunger. \"I don't think you realise how hungry we are in there, we're absolutely starving and when you do get something it tastes like nothing anyway, it's all mush.\" The ITV personality shared what struck her most was how keen all the campmates were to participate in the trials when the moment arrived. When questioned about her winner prediction, Vogue informed Ant and Dec that Ruby Wax could be crowned Queen of the jungle.",

            "content": "It's been five years since Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba The Movie: Mugen Train was released in theaters, making it the highest-grossing Demon Slayer film until the release of Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle. Now, anime fans can relive this fantasy epic in an upcoming physical home release scheduled for next year. Crunchyroll has opened pre-orders for the 4K physical release of Demon Slayer: Mugen Train, scheduled to ship on January 13, 2026. For a listed price of $71. 98, fans will receive a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray disc of the movie, a special accordion booklet, and promised bonus content. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train adapts the \"Mugen Train\" arc of the Demon Slayer manga and takes place directly after the events of Season 1. Tanjiro (Zach Aguilar), Nezuko (Abby Trott), Zenitsu (Aleks Le), and Inosuke (Bryce Papenbrook) board the Mugen Train to assist the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku (Mark Whitten), in finding a demon on board. But as they continue to board the train, the Demon Slayers fall into deep sleep, thanks to a spell by Lower Rank One, Enmu (Landon McDonald). Demon Slayer: Mugen Train was released in 2020 and has since grossed over $484 million worldwide. It was highly praised by fans and critics on Rotten Tomatoes, earning a 98% Certified Fresh critics score and a 99% Verified Hot Audience score. Additionally, the film won numerous accolades, including \"Best Film\" at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards and \"Animation of the Year\" at the Japan Academy Film Prize. How Many Movies Does 'Demon Slayer' Have? Since the anime adaptation of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba premiered in 2019, the Japanese franchise has released two standalone films and two anime compilations. Following the release of Demon Slayer: Mugen Train were Demon Slayer: To the Swordsmith Village and Demon Slayer: To the Hashira Training. The latest release is Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, the first of three installments of the \"Final Battle\" Arc, where the Demon Slayer Corps face Muzan and his army in the Infinity Castle. Altogether, Demon Slayer has grossed over $1 billion at the global box office, with Infinity Castle now the franchise's highest-grossing film at over $662 million. The official release dates for the next Demon Slayer films have not yet been announced, and Infinity Castle has no official streaming release date.",

            "content": "Democrat Senator Mark Kelly claimed Trump threatened to kill him during a press conference on ‘Pentagon intimidation’ on Monday. Mark Kelly is one of the ‘Seditious Six’ Democrat lawmakers who urged members of the military to defy Trump’s orders. Last month, without offering any specifics, Senators Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ), along with Democrat Reps. Maggie Goodlander (NH), Jason Crow (CO), Chris Deluzio (PA), and Chrissy Houlahan (PA) repeatedly stated, “You can refuse illegal orders,” or “You must refuse illegal orders,” in a viral video. WATCH: President Trump previously called for the Democrat lawmakers featured in the viral video to be locked up. Trump also said seditious behavior is punishable by death. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump said on Truth Social. The Department of War last Monday announced it is considering recalling Democrat Senator Mark Kelly for court-martial proceedings after he urged the military to defy President Trump’s orders. Now Mark Kelly is whining about the Pentagon’s investigation into his seditious statements. “President Trump is trying to silence me, threatening to kill me for saying what is true,” Mark Kelly said in an unhinged rant during Monday’s presser. WATCH: Full statement from the Pentagon: The Department of War has received serious allegations of misconduct against Captain Mark Kelly, USN (Ret.). In accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U. S. C. § 688, and other applicable regulations, a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures. This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality. Further official comments will be limited, to preserve the integrity of the proceedings. The Department of War reminds all individuals that military retirees remain subject to the UCMJ for applicable offenses, and federal laws such as 18 U. S. C. § 2387 prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces. Any violations will be addressed through appropriate legal channels. All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful. A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.",

            "content": "We’ve come a long way from Curt Cignetti saying Ohio State sucks into a microphone at Assembly Hall. That comment, which included jabs at rival Purdue and Michigan, was made to fire up a home crowd and energize a moribund fanbase immediately after Cignetti’s hiring in Bloomington. It also served as a way of punching up and a statement on where the Hoosiers’ newest coach would like to take the program. Now, over a year into his tenure, Cignetti is significantly more measured with his words. He’s explained he felt he needed to create excitement upon his arrival, but now his program’s status speaks for itself. Cignetti is typically effusive with praise for opposing teams during his pregame press conferences but reserved some of his most glowing comments for Sunday’s teleconference ahead of No. 2 Indiana’s Big Ten Football Championship game showdown with No. 1 Ohio State this coming Saturday. Asked about Ohio State during a media teleconference on Sunday, Cignetti had the following to say about his counterpart in Saturday’s game: “Ryan Day is a great coach,” Cignetti said. “He’ll be one of the legends of the game someday,” When Day was asked about this remark later, he responded with praise of his own: “Well, that’s quite a compliment,” Day said. “I appreciate him saying that. Not too sure what to think of that, got a lot of football to coach before any of those types of conversations. Day spoke further on Cignetti’s upbringing, noting that he grew up in a football family. Cignetti is the son of Frank Cignetti Sr., a longtime former head coach at West Virginia and IUP and has a brother, Frank Cignetti Jr., who’s coached at the NFL and college levels. He related Cignetti’s upbringing to his relationship with his own son, R. J. Day, a high school quarterback like Cignetti was. “He’s the son of a coach, and everything that comes with that.” Day said. “He just has a feel for the game. When you grow up around this profession, you understand what it’s supposed to look like, you understand people, you understand situations and that’s the way he is and that’s the way he coaches.” Day noted that Cignetti’s coaching ability is reflected in how quickly he was able to turn Indiana’s fortunes around the fact, that he’s won at each of his stops as a head coach and that members of his staff have stayed with him for so long. “I know people laugh about some of the comments he makes about ‘Google him’ and all that but it’s true, and he’s been around football his whole life. It just makes sense to him, he’s been around it. Been around winning football.” The Hoosiers and Buckeyes will clash at 8 p. m. ET on Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a festive gift for a hair styling enthusiast, check out the Shark FlexStyle for $179. 99 at Shark (was $409. 98). I've tested a whole bunch of hair stylers, ranging from ultra-cheap to mega-expensive, and the one I've found myself reaching for the most is the Shark FlexStyle. I thought it was a little overpriced when I first used it, but with this deal it's really incredible value for money. It's rare to find a styler that can do auto-wrap curls (as this one can) for under $200, let alone a great quality option like Shark's. This popular styler is essentially a lightweight, tube-shaped hair dryer with swappable attachments that can be clipped on to create a range of styles. The bundle that's on sale includes auto-wrap curl barrels, a concentrator nozzle, and two brushes one for smoothing and the other for volumizing. Read on for a closer look at the deal, or head to TechRadar's general Cyber Monday deals hub for plenty more discounts on gadgets of all kinds. The best Cyber Monday Shark FlexStyle deal I rate the FlexStyle as one of the best Airwrap dupes around, as well as one of the best hair stylers in general. It feels sturdy and high quality, and the auto-wrap barrels work just as well as the Dyson alternative (although there's no automated curl sequence, you'll have to swap the barrels over when you want to switch the direction of the curl both very acceptable compromises given how much cheaper this version is). The FlexStyle is great as a hair dryer, too: the airflow is powerful, and you can twist the top half of the tube so it sits at a right angle, making the air easy to direct. Head to my Shark FlexStyle review for more info. Alternatives to consider.",

            "content": "BYU is 11-1. They play Texas Tech for the right to call themselves champions of the Big 12 Conference this Saturday in Arlington, Texas. If they win, they will be headed to the College Football Playoff to compete for a national championship. Unfortunately, early this week, that feels like a back-page story. Penn State is seriously interested in making BYU head coach Kalani Sitake their new head man in State College. According to multiple reports, the Nittany Lions have an offer on the table for Sitake to jump to the Big 10. Nothing is imminent as of Monday early afternoon. However, this is a situation where there is certainly a fire under the smoke. There is a real chance Sitake deals the massive payday to don a darker shade of blue on the East Coast. He addressed the media Monday morning and gave no details, unsurprinslgy. Per Jacks.. I’ll address it (to the team), but also, they’re used to me saying, ‘Hey, (coaching rumors are) a good sign that things are going well for us.” Sitake continued, “. We’re trying to finish the season the right way, it’s on us to be our best to play against Texas Tech. So as we go through this week and go through the prep, I also want them to live through all the moments and have a great experience and not waste a moment thinking about anything else.” Sitake is saying all the right things of course, as one would expect. But the rumors are real and the distraction. equally real. Even if the school, the team, and Sitake say they want to avoid distractions heading into one of the biggest football games in BYU history, it’s too late. The toothpaste is out, there’s no putting it back in. There is a non-zero chance that BYU will be essentially head coach-less when they take the field at the home of the Dallas Cowboys, competing for a conference championship and a shot at the College Football Playoff. Frankly, that’s one of the prices of success in the non-SEC-or-Big 10 world. Sitake absolutely deserves a raise, if nothing else. He is 83-44 at BYU since beginning in 2016. Four of the last six seasons have ended in double-digit wins. Beginning in 2023, BYU entered Power Four status in the Big 12. After a rocky first season, the Cougars now have reached 11 wins in back-to-back seasons, going 22-3 since the beginning of 2024. There are very few college football programs who have been more successful than BYU over the last two seasons. It seems like the ball is in BYU’s court to try and match, or at least compete, with Penn State’s offer to keep Sitake in Provo. Sitake and his assistants deserve to be well-compensated for their success the last two seasons. With Sitake or not, the Big 12 will host its championship this Saturday. The players and coaches will try and shake off the distractions and prepare for the nation’s top defense in Texas Tech, and a team set to perhaps earn a bye as a top four team in the College Football Playoff should they beat BYU. Certainly, this is not an ideal start to Conference Championship Week.",

            "content": "Nigeria's defence minister has resigned, the presidency said on Monday, as the country reeled from a security crisis including mass kidnappings of schoolchildren. The departure of Mohammed Badaru Abubakar came after President Bola Tinubu declared a \"nationwide security emergency\" last week as the country scrambled to respond to a wave of mass kidnappings that have seen hundreds of people, mostly schoolchildren, captured within days last month. Tinubu's spokesman, Bayo Onanuga, said in a statement that Abubakar, 63, was quitting with immediate effect, on health grounds. \"His resignation comes amid President Tinubu's declaration of a national security emergency, with plans to elaborate on its scope in due course,\" the spokesman said. Africa's most populous country has long experienced insecurity but the spate of abductions recently has left it scrambling. US President Donald Trump in late October named Nigeria a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) -- a State Department designation for religious freedom violations -- over what he called killing of Christians by \"radical Islamists\". He subsequently threatened to intervene militarily. Washington's rhetoric -- rejected by the Nigerian government and independent security analysts -- has placed the country's security crisis under the spotlight. Armed gangs seized more than 300 teachers and staff at St. Mary's co-education school in north-central Nigeria on November 21. Fifty escaped but the rest are still in captivity. \"The children are fine and will be back soon,\" national security adviser Nuhu Ribadu, was quoted as saying during a high-profile visit with school officials in the town of Kontagora, in central Niger state. Gangs, jihadists Since Boko Haram jihadists kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls from the northeastern town of Chibok in an infamous raid more than a decade ago, Nigeria has struggled to contain mass kidnappings. In addition to kidnappings, which are frequent in Nigeria and are mostly carried out by criminal gangs seeking quick ransom payments, Africa's most populous country has been battling a deadly jihadist insurgency in its northwestern regions, since 2009. In the wake of the kidnappings, the country's president declared emergency, and ordered mass recruitment of police and military personnel. Recent raids have resulted in kidnappings of schoolchildren and teachers, worshippers and priests, a bride and her bridemaids, farmers, women and children as well as farmers across various parts of the country. sn/rmb.",

            "content": "The Raiders fell to 2-10 after a 31-14 loss to the Chargers on Sunday where not only did they look outmatched on offense, but consistently struggled on defense as well. A few lone bright spots for the Raiders came with superstar tight end Brock Bowers along with standout pass rusher Maxx Crosby. Crosby started the season slow recording a career low in pass rush win rate along with lows in his sack rate and pressure rate. After a rough few weeks, Crosby seems to be back to form following the bye week with three TFL vs the Jaguars, two vs the Cowboys, and five last week vs the Browns before another four this week vs the Chargers. Additionally, Crosby has registered 4 sacks since the bye week matching his total before which included 2 vs the Chargers. In other “advanced” metrics, Crosby has seen his run stop win rate over the last five games rise from 36. 8% to 44% which now leads the NFL at EDGE. Crosby also has posted 37 run stop wins in his last five games giving him 93 on the season which is more then 35 than the next closest edge rusher (Rams Jared Verse). As a pass rusher, Crosby saw his win rate rise from 13. 1% before the bye week to 17. 8% currently including three straight games with a win rate over 18%. Despite the Raiders struggles as a defense and in their pass rush situations, Crosby has seen his pressure rate rise as well recording over 22 pressures since the bye week with 7 vs the Cowboys and Chargers. He’s been a dominant run defender his whole career, though this season the Raiders seem to be getting the best of Crosby in the run game where he’s on pace to have a career high in run stops, TFL’s, run defense win rate, and wins. With 5 games remaining on the schedule, the Raiders pass rusher has logged 8 sacks, 59 tackles, 23 TFL’s, 19 QB Hits, 6 PBU, 49 pressures, 44 stops, and 2 FF putting him just in line with his 2021-2023 dominance before an injury in 2024 outside of his total pressure numbers. With just one more TFL Crosby will break his own franchise record of 23 and he’s on pace to break 30 TFL for just the 3rd time ever in NFL history.",

            "content": "AURORA | Newly elected and progressive city council members will be sworn in on Monday, and fellow Democrat Councilmember Alison Coombs already has a few suggested changes. The four new Democratic members of city council, Rob Andrews, Alli Jackson, Gianina Horton and Amy Wiles, along with Democratic incumbent Ruben Medina, will all be sworn in Monday for their first night. After that, the city council is slated to take up some procedural changes sponsored by Coombs. The proposals include changing the seating arrangements of council members on the dais, changing the order of some of the events during the meeting, extending and relaxing public listening times to speak and requiring mayoral appointments to boards and commissions to be approved by the majority of city council. The new council members represent a virtual sea change on the dais, giving Democratic progressives control of the city council, where before the election there were only three of board’s 10 members. Republican incumbents Danielle Jurinsky, Steve Sundberg and Amsalu Kassaw lost their re-election bids. Democrat Crystal Murillo did not run for re-election. Coombs is also the only city council member who submitted an intent to run for Mayor Pro Tem, which will also be decided in Monday’s meeting. “I am interested in improving collaboration across the city and ensuring we are adequately prepared to handle changes effectively,” Coombs said in her internet letter. “We face revenue and other challenges that must be addressed promptly and diligently, and I am prepared to take a strategic approach to them.” The mayor pro tem designation is significant because that city lawmaker chooses which city council members serve on city council policy committees. The only resolution on the agenda addresses rule changes to the Council Rules of Order regarding “Public Invited to be Heard,” ratifying mayoral appointments, the order of the council agenda and seating on the dais, according to city information. The changes to the so-called “Public Invited to be Heard,” or the public listening session before the city council meeting which allows members of the public to speak about items that are not on the agenda, include reinstating the session as part of the city council meeting. It was changed during the summer by the conservative majority of city council members, as part of one of many attempts to control disruptions during meetings wrought by protestors. The protests have, for more than a year, been created by family, friends and activists linked to the 2024 police shooting of Kilyn Lewis during his arrest in Aurora. Making the Public Invited to be Heard part of the meeting requires it to be treated like any other agenda items, which also requires city council members to be present and on the dais to listen to the public. If the resolution is approved by city council tonight, it will also extend the Public Invited to be Heard listening session to an hour or longer before the meeting, with an additional hour or longer after the meeting. The public listening session is also moved in the city council rules of order to happen after roll call, the pledge of allegiance, and the adoption of the agenda, and right before the consent calendar. It will also allow speakers to talk for three minutes instead of two. Members of the public who want to speak are now allowed to sign up online before 1 p. m. on the day of the city council meeting, or in person with the city clerk after 5 p. m. and no later than 5: 45 p. m. “Those who sign up after 5: 45 p. m. will be heard in the order they sign up, regardless of proof of residency,” the proposed changes said. “For the first Public Invited to be Heard portion of the agenda, sign-ups will be accepted until the time the last speaker finishes speaking. For the last Public Invited to be Heard portion of the agenda, sign-ups will be accepted until the item immediately preceding Public Invited to be Heard is finished.” The resolution also proposes eliminating the 30-minute limit for public comment for agenda items if city council approves it. There is another clause that says that if the “Public Invited to be Heard, or any other part of the regular city council meeting becomes disrupted to the extent that it jeopardizes the ability to conduct city business and council decides to move the council meeting to a virtual format, the city manager is directed to order the Aurora Municipal Center closed to the public.” The resolution also proposes changing the mayor’s appointment power of city lawmakers to regional boards, commissions and organizations to require ratification by a majority of city council during study sessions. Finally, seating arrangements on the dias could be changed to have city council members with the most seniority in time served as city council members closest to the city attorney and the city manager, and then moving out alphabetically for those who have served the same amount of time. The majority of city council, including the new members, will need to approve the resolution for the changes to happen.",

            "content": "The United States has meddled for decades in elections around the world. But no modern president has done so as brazenly as Donald Trump. Forget shady CIA-hatched plots or surreptitious media campaigns. Trump has openly called on other countries' electorates to vote for his right-wing friends, often deploying his favorite tool of social media. Most recently, Trump on his Truth Social platform endorsed Honduran right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura as \"the only real friend of Freedom\" and vowed to work with him. Asfura held a narrow lead after voting Sunday. \"I cannot think of a time when a US president was willing to just openly state his preferences in foreign elections in this way, at least in modern history,\" said Thomas Carothers, director of the democracy, conflict and governance program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Trump has felt especially emboldened in Latin America, where the United States has long intervened. Trump's secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has belittled Colombia's elected left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, as a \"lunatic,\" and imposed sanctions on a Brazilian judge who prosecuted former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro for trying to overturn election results. In Argentina, Trump promised $20 billion to prop up the struggling economy but warned it would vanish if voters rejected President Javier Milei in legislative elections. The firebrand libertarian's party ultimately triumphed. \"It's a consistent attempt to influence the politics, to reinforce what I think they see as already a shift towards the right that's gaining force across the region,\" said Will Freeman, a fellow on Latin America at the Council on Foreign Relations. In Venezuela, where there is no election to influence, Trump has suggested the use of US military might to remove leftist leader Nicolas Maduro. Eye on Europe Trump has also sought to tip the scales in Europe. His homeland security chief, Kristi Noem, on a visit to Poland openly endorsed Karol Nawrocki, the conservative candidate for president who went on to win. Trump had less success in Romania, where a far-right ally lost the presidential election, but only after a previous vote was controversially annulled. Vice President JD Vance on a trip to Germany publicly attacked restrictions on the far-right AfD party. Trump or his aides have heaped praise on British anti-migrant lawmaker Nigel Farage and criticized a court ruling in France against far-right leader Marine le Pen. The Trump administration has also stripped back decades of efforts to promote democracy overseas, with Rubio issuing a cable instructing embassies to avoid most commentary on the legitimacy of elections abroad. The stance mirrors Trump's approach to elections at home. He refused to accept his 2020 loss and was charged with trying to overturn results in the state of Georgia -- a case dropped last week in light of his 2024 election victory. Trump, perhaps mindful of his own experience, has publicly urged Israel's president to pardon scandal-tainted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Unique Trump approach Ironically, Trump in a speech in Riyadh in May denounced interventionism, at least in the Middle Eastern context, saying that past US efforts had turned into disasters. Political scientist Dov Levin in a 2021 book found that the United States had intervened in foreign elections more than 80 times since the end of World War II -- more than any other country. Still, Carothers said that Trump was unique not only in his public methods but in his apparent motivations. \"It's different than during the Cold War when the United States often favored a particular person, but they did so for geostrategic reasons,\" he said. \"What we have here is more that Donald Trump feels he has a group of friends out there in the world whom he wants to help,\" he said. Carothers said that only Russia came close in tactics, with the Kremlin weighing in heavily to make known its preferences in former Soviet bloc countries, such as recently in Moldova where its candidate lost. \"A very high percentage of European leaders would like to see Viktor Orban lose the next election, but they're not going to say so out loud,\" he said, referring to Hungary's right-wing populist prime minister. Trump welcomed Orban to the White House last month. Speaking together to reporters, Trump said that European leaders needed to appreciate Orban more. sct-lb/sla.",

            "content": "A powerful blast is forecast to plunge much of the central and eastern United States with some of the planet’s most extreme cold temperatures right before Christmas, according to a recent forecast. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) climatologist Judah Cohen forecasts that from the Midwest to the East Coast, temperatures will run 15-20 degrees below normal for much of the second half of December, with the coldest anomalies arriving around the third week of the month. (RELATED: Authorities Issue Winter Storm Alert For Millions As Powerful Nor’easter Set To Blast East Coast With Snow, Ice) “My thinking is that the cold the first week of December is the appetizer and the main course will be in mid-December,” said Cohen to USA Today. “The most expansive region of most likely extreme cold on Earth stretches from the Canadian Plains to the US East Coast in the 3rd week of December,” said Cohen, who cited his weather modeling computer and its discoveries, per the New York Post. The brutal cold will be driven by a major southward plunge of the polar vortex, allowing a massive surge of arctic air to spill across the United States. The exact depth of the cold remains uncertain and will vary by region, but Cohen has expectations that temperatures in most areas will drop below the levels currently being experienced.",

            "content": "The Cleveland Browns have announced that starting right guard Wyatt Teller will be out against the Tennessee Titans in Week 14. The news was first reported by Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland. com. Teller is recently coming off one of his more interesting games of 2025, rotating snaps with backup guard Teven Jenkins due to a coach’s decision. Now, Teller has been ruled out with a calf injury before the Browns begin their preparations for the upcoming game this Sunday and will be week to week. While the team continues to make these head-scratching moves with one of their most reliable offensive linemen, Teven Jenkins will take all of the snaps at right guard against the Titans. Jenkins was productive for most of the Browns’ preseason in 2025. During the 2024 regular season with the Chicago Bears, he managed to collect a 75. 4 overall PFF grade that ranked 14th among 77 guards in the NFL. A starter for the Bears, he produced this grade in an impressive 738 total snaps played. He also committed only four penalties all of last year, a trend the Browns will need him to continue in order to help ensure success for the offense. After some warm-up reps in Week 13, Jenkins will get the start against a 1-11 Tennessee Titans roster. While they aren’t expected to bring much pressure to the quarterback, Jenkins and company will need to be well prepared for any disruptions to the offense.",

            "content": "Heading into her second season as head coach, BGSU softball’s Michelle Gardner announced seven incoming freshman signees to the program. Gardner led the Falcons to their best record in a season since 2022 in 2025, with a 16-6 overall record and seven conference wins in 22 games. The seven listed incomers will join BG in the 2026-27 academic year, meaning they will not play their first season in the spring of 2026, but rather in the spring of 2027. The Falcons landed six freshman signees and a transfer to play in the spring of 2026, stacking seven freshman signees and a transfer on the roster for the 2025 season. Lilly Atkinson- East Troy, Wisconsin/ East Troy High School Atkinson hit for a . 548 batting average and a 1. 691 OPS in her junior high school season in 2025, earning a first-team all-conference selection. In travel ball this summer and fall, Atkinson swung a . 355 batting average with a . 954 OPS as she heads into her senior spring of softball at East Troy H. S. “Lilly is a very competitive, strong athlete,” said Gardner. “She is a solid outfielder who has a very good arm and great range. Offensively, Lilly hits for average but has power potential as well. I have had the pleasure of watching Lilly grow over the past few years. She has worked very hard to get to the next level, and I look forward to watching her continue to grow with us.” Maddie Franke- Curtice, Ohio/ Oregon Clay High School Franke earned a selection to the All-Ohio Second Team, All-Northwest District First Team and All-Northern Lakes League Team in the spring of 2025. She plays travel for the Ohio Stingrays and contributes defensively as both a catcher and outfielder. “Offensively, Maddie hits for average but has power potential as well as great speed,” said Garnder. “ While watching her over the past year, I’ve grown to appreciate all she brings to the table. She is fast and smart on the field and will help us in many areas. Brooklyn Kemp- Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania/ Upper St. Clair High School A pitcher in her senior year at Upper St. Clair H. S., Kemp has been named to the All-Section Team in three straight seasons, playing travel for Indiana Magic Gold. “’BK,’ as she is known by her teammates and coaches, has a very calm demeanor on the mound,” said Garnder. “Whether she is starting a game or going into a tough situation, her presence on the mound never changes; she is out there to do her job. Her ability to keep hitters off balance while facing some of the best players in the country makes her a great addition to our program.” Mya Lewis- Martinsville, Indiana/ Martinsville High School An infielder, Lewis will play her final season of high school softball at Martinsville in the spring of 2025, finishing her travel career this coming summer with Diamond Dynamics based out of Bloomington, Indiana. “Mya is a very athletic player who has the potential to play anywhere in the infield for us,” Gardner said. “She hits for average but also has some power potential. I’ve had the pleasure of watching Mya grow as a softball player from the age of 10, when she played with my daughter in Indiana. I knew she would be a great player when she grew older, and I am very excited to have the opportunity to work with her now in college.” Quinn Loar- Grove City, Ohio/ Grove City High School In her senior season at Grove City H. S., Loar has earned an All-Ohio Capital Conference honor in each of her last two seasons. The catcher also received All-District First Team accolades and plays travel softball for Ohio Lasers Red. Quinn is a very strong athlete who will see time behind the plate but could also see time at first,” said Gardner. “Offensively, she has power, and we are looking for her to have an immediate impact on our program. Quinn is tough behind the plate and works well with her pitchers. She competes every pitch to help her pitcher, and her ability to win pitches will benefit us greatly. Kadyn Sanchez- Oxnard, California/ Santa Clara High School In her junior season in 2025, Sanchez earned California All-State First Team honors by Cal-HiSports and was also named to the All-CIF Southern Section First Team. The pitcher plays summer softball for the Corona Angels. Kadyn is a strong pitcher who competes against the toughest competition week in and week out in Southern California,” said Gardner. “She is a dynamic competitor who is committed to being the best she can be. Kadyn works just as hard in the weight room as she does on the mound, understanding what it takes to be successful at the next level. She brings a mix of speed and movement and is not afraid of any situation.” Drea Watts- Barboursville, West Virginia/ Cabell Midland High School Watts pitches for Cabell Midland H. S. and was named the West Virginia Gatorade Player of the Year in 2024-25 as just a junior. She was additionally selected as Mountain State Athletic Conference Player of the Year and plays travel for the Ohio Hawks. “Drea is an extremely competitive pitcher who was the West Virginia Gatorade Player of the Year in 2025,” said Gardner. “Drea has incredible movement on her pitches and commands the zone. She will give a different look from our other pitchers, which will complement our entire pitching staff. Watching her compete this past summer with a broken finger tells me she is tough as nails. She will go through the wall for this program and can make an immediate impact on our program.” The recruiting class, playing their first season in the spring of 2027, includes three pitchers, two catchers, and an infielder and outfielder. After the upcoming 2026 season, Bowling Green softball will lose an infielder, a utility player, a pitcher, a catcher, and two outfielders, not including possible outgoing transfers. The team’s first weekend of the regular season will take place in Hampton, Virginia, against Queens and Hampton, a double header on both Feb. 6 and 7.",

            "content": "Ford’s future product roadmap has gotten messy as the company has killed or delayed a number of upcoming models. Most of these have been fully electric as the automaker axed their three-row EVs and recently halted F-150 Lightning production at least temporarily. Amid this chaos, Ford isn’t throwing in the towel on EVs. Quite the opposite as the company is working on a mid-size truck that will be launched in 2027 and ride on the all-new Universal EV Platform. The latter will eventually underpin a “family of affordable vehicles.” More: Ford Gives Taurus And Mondeo A Mustang Glow-Up For 2026 That family could include a rear-wheel drive, high-performance sedan that would be affordable. Ford CEO Jim Farley hinted at the car in a recently posted video, which was taken a few months ago at Monterey Car Week. Return of the Sedan? The executive didn’t say much about it, but implied the mysterious model has a clean silhouette as well as a “cool closure” system in the back, which enables it to carry a lot of stuff. This suggests the car could be a liftback sedan, which would broaden its appeal in the crossover era. Little else is known about the vehicle, but Ford has been hinting at a Mustang sedan since 2022. The company also reportedly showed dealers a rendering in 2024 and this could presumably be what Farley is talking about. Also: This Is An Official Ford Mustang Sedan Sketch And We Love It While that remains unclear, the executive said “There’s definitely a market for sedans, a huge market.” However, he said their previous generations of sedans failed in America because they were built on European platforms to European standards. This resulted in expensive cars, which cost the company a lot of money. Fusion Died So Bronco and Maverick Could Live Farley went on to point out that the Bronco and Maverick never would have happened if they continued making the Fusion. As he explained, they took the money from cars to invest it elsewhere. This has proven to be a wise move and Ford has focused on the “sweet zone” with Broncos, Mustangs, and Raptors. Elsewhere in the interview, Farley shared praise for the Xiaomi SU7. He also talked about his dream of doing an off-road supercar. We’ve covered the latter before, but in this interview he described it as a WRC [World Rally Championship] car for four people as well as something like a Raptor R without a pickup bed. He went on to say the model would be partially electric and have 1, 000 hp (746 kW / 1, 014 PS). Of course, it’s all just a lot of talk at this point and Ford has been having problems executing their vision. Besides botched EV plans in America, the company’s European turnaround has stumbled with rebadged VWs. This is on top of 138 recalls and counting.",

            "content": "Paramount wants to keep the Sonic the Hedgehog movie machine running through 2028: A fifth Sonic movie, which appears to be a spinoff, and not necessarily Sonic the Hedgehog 5, is already on the books, Variety reported Monday. We're already getting Sonic the Hedgehog 4, which has a March 19, 2027 release date and may or may not be titled Sonic CD but Paramount has now committed to a new \"Sonic Universe Event Film,\" for a Dec. 22, 2028 debut in theaters. It's unclear what Paramount plans to do with the Sonic Universe, but after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which introduced fan-favorite Shadow, a stand-alone movie starring Keanu Reeves' character certainly seems within the realm of possibility (and profitability). Knuckles has already got his spinoff. But there are limitless options when it comes to the Sonic Universe, such as A Big the Cat spinoff, which will be inevitable after Big the Cat is introduced in the live-action/animated hybrid series An adaptation of Mario & Sonic at The Olympic Games, given that the next Olympics will happen in 2028 in Los Angeles and the world will still be in the throes of Olympic Fever Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II, should the dense tome that is Sonic the Hedgehog 4 actually require two movies to tell, and because nothing has ever gone wrong with Sonic the Hedgehog when delivered in episodic form The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog: A Knives Out Mystery, which I think would qualify as a challenge for writer-director Rian Johnson Sonic the Hedgehog 4 promises to be a crowded affair, as the follow-up to Sonic 3 portended the arrival of Amy Rose and Metal Sonic in the live-action Sonic Universe. Should Jim Carrey return as Robotnik, alongside Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Tom, and Maddie, the film will have quite a few characters to juggle. (So far, no one is officially attached to Sonic 4, even three-time Sonic director Jeff Fowler.).",

            "content": "President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser Kevin Hassett drew criticism online this weekend after boasting of a paltry decrease in the cost of turkey this Thanksgiving as evidence of Trump’s strength in handling the economy. Kevin Hassett, who chairs the White House National Economic Council, suggested that his family’s Thanksgiving meal was more plentiful than ever this year due to a savings of 19 cents. “Turkey prices were down 19 cents,” he said in an appearance on “Fox & Friends Weekend” Sunday. “I bought two different ones because some other show was criticizing me because I said, ‘Oh, generic turkeys are pretty good.’ So I made two this time and I didn’t really notice the difference. So buy the cheaper turkey next year, folks. But you can get the fancy one if you want, too.” Not surprisingly, Hassett’s remarks were widely mocked and debated on social media. “One person’s grocery receipt isn’t economic data. National food inflation requires broader metrics than a sample size of two turkeys,” one person wrote on X. Politics: Economist Pulls Apart Trump’s Latest Boasts: ‘My Kids Don’t Even Lie That Often’ Added another: “‘I bought 2 turkeys!!’ is not a great response to ‘Americans can’t afford to eat.’” It’s unclear where Hassett had received the 19-cent statistic, or whether he was referring to the total cost of the turkey itself versus the price per pound. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index recently found that food-at-home prices increased by 2. 7% from September 2024 to September 2025. His comments also followed a contentious interview with ABC’s Jonathan Karl last month in which he defended Trump’s debunked claim that the overall cost of Thanksgiving dinner this year was less than it was under former President Joe Biden. “You want us to fix the hole that Joe Biden caused right away,” he said. “The prices went up so much under Joe Biden, and inflation is way down.” Politics: Donald Trump’s ‘Gross’ Answer To National Guard Member Funeral Question Draws Fury Online Hassett who in 2024 had assets worth at least $7. 6 million, according to Bloomberg ― is reportedly Trump’s top pick for the next Federal Reserve chair. The president recently deemed sitting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell a “numbskull” for not cutting interest rates quickly enough, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there was “a very good chance” Trump will announce an appointee before Christmas.

However, Schiff must just have discovered how to use AI to push his BS and maybe he wishes that had been available when he was peddling the \"Russia collusion\" lie. That's the thing about ballrooms -- no two look alike -- and if they do one must be connected to the other! Next up from Schiff: You know who else had a ballroom? HITLER!\" A lot of career politicians do it the other way around, and Dems like Schiff think Nancy/Bernie/Barack the way to do it is on the up-and-up. Next maybe Schiff could ask AI how somebody might go about getting out of charges of mortgage fraud and to keep an autopen pardon from being reversed. hypothetically speaking of course. It's been generally agreed by people who have been there who don't suffer from TDS that the White House could use something like Trump's building. Entertaining foreign dignitaries in big tents wasn't a good look for the home of the most powerful office in the world. Having a serial liar like Schiff in the Senate isn't a good look either, but here we are. ***** Editor’s Note: The Democrat Party has never been less popular as voters reject its globalist agenda, domestic lunacy and Adam Schiff's serial lying.",

For the quarter that ended on Oct. 31, MongoDB reported adjusted earnings per share of $1. 32, up from a loss of $1. 16 per share in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, on revenue of $628. 3 million, up 19% year-over-year. Both figures were well ahead of the 81 cents per share and revenue of $593. 78 million expected by analysts. MongoDB saw subscription revenue in the quarter of $609. 1 million, up 19% year-over-year and services revenue of $19. 2 million, up 12% year-over-year. As of the end of the quarter, MongoDB was sitting on $2. 3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, with the figure helped by $143. 5 million in cash from operations through the quarter. Business highlights in the quarter included the Sept. 16 launch of a new artificial intelligence-powered service that is designed to modernize legacy applications. The MongoDB Application Modernization Platform combines tooling, structured modernization methodologies and human expertise to transform decades-old applications into modern, scalable services. On Sept. 17, MongoDB revealed that search and vector search features that had previously been confined to its Atlas cloud platform are now available for self-managed deployments, including MongoDB Community Edition and MongoDB Enterprise Server. The feature puts advanced AI-building tools in the hands of millions of developers operating local and on-premises environments. The company also launched a number of AI development, security and governance technology integrations with Microsoft that the company says solidify its position as the best data foundation for AI on Microsoft Azure. “Q3 was an exceptional quarter. Existing customers are expanding with us and net-new customer additions continue to show strength,” said CJ Desai, president and chief executive officer of MongoDB, in the company’s earnings release. “Companies across industries and geographies are choosing MongoDB because we provide a unified data platform that powers mission-critical workloads today and also positions them to capitalize on the emerging AI platform shift.” For its fiscal 2026 fourth quarter, MongoDB expects adjusted earnings per share of $1. 44 to $1. 46 and revenue of $665 million to $670 million. For the full year, the company expects adjusted earnings of $4. 76 to $4. 80 per share on revenue of $2. 434 billion to $2. 439 billion. The full-year guidance was revised up from previous guidance of $2. 34 billion to $2. 36 billion given by MongoDB at the end of its previous quarter. The outlook also came in ahead of the $2. 36 billion expected by analysts. Photo: MongoDB.",

Had Europeans never made it over here, maybe the answer would be simpler: American food would be what the native peoples of this land fostered and ate. However, Europeans did come, throwing the whole notion into chaos and, in the process, creating an at-times baffling, more often than not derivative, yet completely unique and mightily influential food culture. Although there are always nuances throughout their different regions, many other countries simply have a stronger gastronomic identity than the U. S. When someone mentions Greek food, or French food, or Indian food, you can picture a certain thing. Certain ingredients, certain flavor profiles, and a particular aesthetic are often perceived to be time-honored and indelible to that place and people. But it's slightly more complicated in the United States. The same culture that brought the world Little Caesar's also delivered some of the world's most spectacular fine-dining restaurants. The same culture that sells sprayable whipped cheese also has the most cosmopolitan food cities. It's a culture whose culinary heritage has been heavily influenced by other cuisines, yet the ingredients and flavorings originally cultivated in this soil have also irrevocably transformed cuisines everywhere. This is American food. But what actually is it? Most of us complain about travel, but let's take a moment to appreciate the first humans to arrive in the Americas. When those hardy, intrepid people journeyed here tens of thousands of years ago, they were confronted with mammoths, giant bears, saber-toothed cats, and sloths the size of RVs. The enormous beasts were happy either eating them or stomping them into prehistoric jelly. Not fun. The upside is that those same humans were also introduced to the super-region's bounty of native plants, fruits, vegetables, and spices that are still in our diets today. These ingredients were growing wild throughout the lands, with squash being one of the first foods to become domesticated once agriculture was initiated on this side of the world. As humans settled further into the continent, they came across and eventually cultivated the likes of peanuts, chili peppers, tomatoes, and cocoa (chocolate). These four alone have gone on to become staple components of food cultures the world over, not only in the U. S. What are Reese's Pieces without peanut butter? Our salsas and Buffalo wings without peppers? No tomatoes? You can forget about pizza. And chocolate? Is it even America without chocolate? Aside from these and other iconic fare, spices derived from indigenous vegetation have long animated our palates: allspice, sumac, mint, sage, and juniper, to name just a few. Those early Americans probably had no idea the nutriments they were gathering and farming would, across many centuries and ages and societal evolutions, help shape the likes of Del Taco. Oh, and our entire modern landscape of eating. Cahokia, a Native American city that once thrived near today's St. Louis, had a staggering population of at least 10, 000 before the Renaissance even hit Europe. A kind of Mississippian New York City, its existence justifiably reshuffles our Old World-versus-New World outlook regarding civilization. It also begs the question of how it fed its thousands of denizens, who lived both within and around the massive, mound-based metropolis. Archaeological evidence shows that the highly organized city satiated its masses with corn, squash, grains, seeds, and native game, used in stews, porridges, bread, and hominy. Cahokia was an urban center for the pre-Columbian Mississippian people, but it was really a culmination of Native American genius from across the continent. This agricultural brilliance was apparent in the use of the Three Sisters method after Indigenous farmers discovered that planting the trio of corn, squash, and beans next to each other was both productive and sustainable. Native American groups developed their own regional meals based on what was available locally. Along the eastern coasts, you had dishes that included fresh fish, shellfish, and clams. In the southeast, you had succotash. The people of the Great Plains feasted on loads of bison, venison, and rabbit, often cooked over an open fire. In the southwest, you had clay pot cooking with ingredients like maize, sunflower seeds, and trout. And up the West Coast into what is now Alaska, people feasted on game, berries, and the biggie: salmon. In each of these native styles of cooking, we see the ancestry of our present-day American food cultures, from New England seafood to Southern soul food to California cuisine. Europeans settled on the American continent in the 15th and 16th centuries. This marked huge changes in how the world eats and what American food would become. For example, settlers brought with them two animals that changed the course of gastronomy on these shores: pigs and cows. Can you fathom this country's food life without either pork or beef? Nathan's would be having a gourd-eating contest every Fourth of July. The Pilgrims of New England were in dire need of sustenance after arriving in the New World. Having, in short order, run out of the stuff they brought (flour supplies were dwindling, the barley was primarily used for beer, and the peas and other plants proved less than fruitful), the Pilgrims had to rely on Native American help. Tribes like the Wampanoags taught them how to farm, hunt, and fish. Corn was a godsend to these under-resourced newcomers, who were able to use the crop for bread, beer, and other things. Meanwhile, the Dutch settlement of New Netherland which included the future site of New York had a somewhat smoother culinary symbiosis. The Dutch introduced livestock, apples, and wheat to the nearby Indigenous tribes. Native Americans introduced corn and squash. They also taught the Dutch how to make a cornmeal-based porridge called sapaen that the Netherlanders loved and relied upon. The Dutch returned the favor by getting the Native Americans into bread, pretzels, and even cookies. By the time the English took control of the Eastern seaboard and the 13 colonies were formed, what and how Americans ate started to look somewhat similar to what we enjoy today. Although the exact cuisines still varied from area to area, colonists would have partaken in something close to cereal for breakfast, meat, bread, and cheese for lunch, and stews, savory pies, or porridges for dinner. Dessert would be on tap sometimes, too. Sugar was hard to come by, but maple syrup, honey, and molasses could sweeten baked items such as fruit pies. Even fried dough was a common item in certain colonies. So, next time you're at a fair chowing down on a funnel cake for one, you can do so knowing that your ancestors may have done the same. One thing that can't be overstated is the vast quantity of alcohol consumed by the colonists. They basically had beer or hard cider with most meals. Even the kiddos drank a diluted kind of brewski. It's thought that colonists in the 1700s drank about double the amount of alcohol annually that we do today. George Washington, Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson they all liked a drink. The boozy intake was for good reason, however. Water at the time often came from polluted sources, so an alcoholic beverage seemed like the safer option. It's amazing to think the Revolutionary War was won by an army nursing a persistent hangover. Imagine a cannon blast after a night out on ye towne? No, thanks. The beginning of the 1800s in the young, freshly independent United States would look like a distant, far-gone world by the end of the century. The country would undergo an epic metamorphosis in those hundred years, in many different ways. Two of those transformative areas would be directly linked: immigration and food. Chinese immigration began in the 1820s but accelerated during the Gold Rush. It was a similar trajectory for Mexicans after many were initially folded into the U. S. population through territorial gain. Over the course of the 1800s, there was a deluge of immigration from Western Europe especially Germany, Ireland, and Italy. Things changed accordingly. Street vendors started hawking a wider range of foods, reflecting the cuisine of their home countries, while grocery stores began selling imported food goods. The result: foods and drinks we now couldn't imagine living without entered the American diet for the first time. Tamales, spaghetti, sausages, pickles, and fried rice are just a few of the other headliners that began filling American bellies during this era. And let's not forget that Germans practically created the modern American beer industry by introducing lager to these shores and starting iconic companies like Anheuser-Busch and Pabst. In the 1830s, two Italian-Swiss brothers Giovanni and Pietro Delmonico decided to change things up at their sweet shop in Manhattan. The entrepreneurs set up tables and invited customers to come in, sit down, and enjoy fresh plates of food. These patrons received a document to see what was available and how much it cost. Thus, America's first fine dining restaurant was born. Sure, taverns and inns and other public houses had been offering eats for ages. But Delmonico's in New York City, along with Antoine's in New Orleans the oldest restaurant in the state were fresh harbingers of things to come. Delmonico's not only pioneered this kind of refined public eating, but also boasted the man considered to be America's first celebrity chef, Charles Ranhofer. The concept of a restaurant, as we know it today, is something we often take for granted, but it has only been around for less than 200 years. Many Europeans in the early days would deride American food after visiting including Charles Dickens, whose culinary experiences in the U. S. were disastrous. Although you could say that Dickens's great expectations were not met, it's inconceivable to imagine America without this social innovation. Everything from The French Laundry to IHOP owes its existence to the roots planted by America's oldest restaurants. And sure, menus from this bygone era feature things we probably wouldn't see at our neighborhood Applebee's namely, pickled lamb's tongue, stewed prunes, scrambled eggs with kidney, and something called Scotch woodcock they did feature now-familiar American fare like hash browns, gumbo, soft-shell crab, and tons of ice cream. If you were to ask someone to name a quintessential American food, chances are either hamburgers, hot dogs, or pizza will be mentioned. Like Elvis Presley, the Harlem Globetrotters, and Hulk Hogan ripping off his shirt, those three foods just scream America at the world which is itself a very American way to go about it. But it was Germans in 19th-century New York who first sold hot dogs from carts and stands. We have Germans to thank for the hamburger, too. It's all in the name, of course. People immigrating out of Deutschland from the massive port of Hamburg took a dish called frikadellen with them, which was basically cooked ground meat. As it traveled throughout the States, it came to be called Hamburg steak and was put in between slices of bread for the first time, allegedly, at Louis' Lunch in Connecticut (which still exists today). And then there's pizza. Sure, toppings on flatbread have been around for ages. There's even a depiction of one such concoction on a mural at Pompeii. But the iconic American pizza that we know was brought here by Neapolitans in the late 1800s and early 1900s (although it didn't really gain mainstream popularity in the U. S. until soldiers returning from Italy after World War II developed a craving for it). Topped by the tomatoes Europe would have never known existed if it wasn't for the Indigenous Mesoamerican peoples, one can argue that pizza along with hamburgers and hot dogs represents the essence of what American food is: the Old World using the New World to create something novel and accessible. World War II had an irrevocable influence on how Americans eat. An army marches on its stomach, as Napoleon famously said, and U. S soldiers in the trenches of European and Pacific battlefields had to be fed. American industry responded by mass-manufacturing processed food that was ready-made, portable, and storable. Eventually the war ended. Companies were stuck with a surplus of canned, prepared product. At the same time, the mainstream American housewife who had been propping the homeland up on her shoulders and kept it running while the boys were off fighting was returning to life in the kitchen with less taste for domestic duties. Manufacturers solved their glut by parlaying this newfound antipathy. They refined and marketed processed foods to the general public. Advertisers touted everything from condensed soup, Spam, and TV dinners to Minute Rice, Frosted Flakes and Tang, framing them as miracles that would make life easier and freer for everyone in the household. Food was gelatinized, powdered, whizzed, and supposedly good for you (but really wasn't). This changed the American stomach forever often not for the better. (Couldn't have been a good sign that cigarette companies like Philip Morris jumped into the processed food game, applying their unscrupulous marketing tactics.) The other side of this mid-century revolution (devolution?) in American satiation was the rise of fast food. This came with construction of the national highway system. People got out and drove, travelling longer distances on commutes and travels. This shrunk the amount of time people spent preparing meals, and made places like White Castle (the forerunner), McDonald's, Dairy Queen, and Kentucky Fried Chicken inextricable facets of American food life. Despite Big Macs, Blizzards, and the Colonel becoming the country's taste ambassadors to the world, a look around the contemporary American food landscape offers a more varied view. Informed by its land's millennia of fertile production, the constant influx and inheritance of cultures, traditions, and ideas, and a magnetic presence in the modern world, you see an abundance of cutting-edge gastronomic creativity that is cross-cultural and ever-evolving. You can also still see the low-brow, ultra-processed, junk food side, which is also cross-cultural and ever-evolving. There are the classics. There are the oddities. There are the innovations. And all the categories are flexible. Today, pizza is still a paragon in the U. S., but avocado toast is probably consumed as much as hot dogs. Expensive meats can be as beloved a post-bar munch as a hamburger. Duck foam stands alongside frozen burritos. And if you ask Americans themselves what genuine America food is, they'll throw out a whole range of eats: Texas barbecue, popcorn, scrapple, key lime pie, pork roll, German chocolate cake (named after an American dude with the last name German, by the way), New York cheesecake, cheesecake ice cream, fajitas. Maybe it's not about asking what American food is, but what it definitely isn't: one, definable thing.",

Flick of course took his place centre stage in the media headlines over the last 48 hours. As much comes after the German was left looking inconsolable in the aftermath of his side’s La Liga clash with Alavés. Despite Barcelona emerging on the right side of a 3-1 result, Flick painted the picture of an utterly dejected figure, whilst sitting on the bench post-match. So lost did the former Bayern Munich boss look, that Raphinha felt it necessary to step in, to check on his manager’s wellbeing. Speaking in his latest press conference on Monday, it therefore came as little surprise when the incident was put to Flick himself. And the 60-year-old was characteristically honest in his response, explaining: “My moment with Raphinha? Well, it was a funny thing, I don’t know who first described that I was sad in that clip, but I was frustrated. We lost a lot of balls, and I was also frustrated because we got two suspensions from the bench, so I had to turn around every time and ask my team to be calm. When we scored the third goal, Marcus Sorg got suspended. Marcus is my friend, and he’s the most important person to me on the staff, and part of my family.” Conor Laird GSFN.",

            "content": "US President Donald Trump will hold a meeting at the White House on Monday evening about next steps on Venezuela, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, as the administration intensifies its pressure campaign on the country and questions mount about whether the military is exceeding its lawful authority. Key members of Trump's Cabinet and national security team, including Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to attend, as well as White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The meeting, which is expected to take place at 5 p. m. ET (9am AEDT) in the Oval Office, comes as the United States has increased pressure on Venezuela with strikes on drug vessels and a military asset buildup in the Caribbean. The US military has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15, 000 troops in the region as part of what the Pentagon has branded \"Operation Southern Spear.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump was \"meeting with his national security team on this subject and on many matters,\" adding, \"It's part of his responsibility to ensure that peace is ongoing throughout the world.\" The meeting also comes as Trump and his top military officials are facing growing questions about the legality of the US strikes on alleged drug boats in the region killing more than 80 people. The US is not officially in a war with Venezuela, and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have said they plan to examine reports that the US carried out a follow-up strike on a suspected drug vessel after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board. \"The law is clear,\" Maine Senator Angus King, an independent, told CNN on Monday morning. \"If the facts are, as have been alleged, that there was a second strike specifically to kill the survivors in the water that's a stone-cold war crime. It's also murder.\" On Monday, Leavitt identified the official who ordered the follow-up strike Admiral Frank M. \"Mitch\" Bradley, commander of the US Special Operations Command and said he was acting \"well within his authority. On September 2, Secretary Hegseth authorised Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" Leavitt said. Pressed on the legal justification for the strike, Leavitt said it was \"conducted in self-defence to protect Americans\" and was carried out \"in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\" Trump told reporters that he personally would not have wanted a second strike and seemed to cast doubt on the idea Hegseth had ordered it. \"No. 1, I don't know that that happened, and Pete said he did not want them he didn't even know what people were talking about,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"So, we'll look into it, but no, I wouldn't have wanted that, not a second strike.\" King, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Congress would seek to interview \"people up and down the chain of command. The question is, what order did the Secretary of Defence give and how was that executed? And we're going to be talking to people, as I say, all the way up, up to the top of the chain of command and down to the people that actually triggered that attack,\" he said. Leavitt said Hegseth had spoken with lawmakers who expressed concerns, but she did not specify which ones. She generally defended the amount of information the administration has shared with Congress about the escalating campaign. \"There have also been 13 bipartisan briefings to Congress on the Venezuelan strikes. There have been a number of document reviews for members of Congress to review the classified DOJ Office of Legal Counsel opinion and other related documents,\" Leavitt said. And the administration has shown no signs of slowing its activity in the region. The president said last week that the US would be stopping Venezuelan drug trafficking by land, in addition to sea, \"very soon.\" Over the weekend, the president issued a broad directive on social media, warning airlines, pilots and criminal networks to avoid Venezuelan airspace. He told reporters not to read into the announcement. Trump also confirmed he had spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the phone, but didn't address what was discussed. The administration last week formally designated Maduro and allies of his government as members of a foreign terrorist organisation, a move officials argue will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela. GOP Representative Maria Salazar, meanwhile, said she felt Trump's announcement that he planned to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, effectively erasing a major US drug-trafficking conviction, sent a mixed message as the administration escalated its campaign against Maduro. \"I would have never done that,\" the Florida Republican told CNN's Dana Bash. Leavitt on Monday defended the move, arguing that the former Honduran president's US drug-trafficking conviction was a result of Biden-era \"over-prosecution. President Trump has been quite clear in his defence of the United States homeland, to stop these illegal narcotics from coming to our borders, whether that's by land or by sea,\" Leavitt said. \"He's also made it quite clear that he wants to correct the wrongs of the weaponised Justice Department under the previous administration.

            "content": "The Cleveland Browns' season is likely over with Sunday's 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. The AFC North has been a mess this season, but sitting at 3-9 with and trailing the division-leading Ravens and Steelers by three games with five to go is almost certainly too tough of a climb for Cleveland. The Athletic's playoff simulator gives the Browns a less-than-one percent chance to make the postseason, and an 86 percent chance to finish the year with between four and six wins total. The rest of Cleveland's season will likely be centered around answering questions regarding the future trajectory of this team. It certainly feels like the Browns' coaching staff will be attempting to save their jobs over the final month of the year, and while the team's 2025 draft class has provided several pieces worth building around, the Browns will need to find out just how much work they need to do at the quarterback position this offseason. Let's take a look at how the Browns used their personnel in Sunday's loss, as they prepare to head into the final stretch of this season. The 100%ers Offense (2): OT Cam Robinson, G Joel Bitonio It's a remarkably small club this week. Starting quarterback Shedeur Sanders was not on the field for two of the Browns' 63 offensive snaps -- including one where Dillon Gabriel replaced him, after Sanders seemed to suffer an injury after attempting a slide in the fourth quarter -- and no player on defense played more than 95% of Cleveland's defensive snaps. Offense Backup guard Teven Jenkins, who signed a one-year deal with the Browns this offseason, played a season-high 54% of the snaps, as the Browns rotated him in and out with starter Wyatt Teller on Sunday. Teller played 49% of the Browns' offensive snaps. Elsewhere on the offensive line, KT Leveston played 57% of the snaps, as starting right tackle Jack Conklin was limited to 44% due to his entrance into concussion protocol. Rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr., once again, led all skill position players in snaps, playing 92% of Cleveland's offensive snaps. That contrasted with veteran David Njoku, who at 51% was significantly out-snapped by Fannin for the second-straight week. At wide receiver, the usual duo of Jerry Jeudy (84%) and Cedric Tillman (63%) led the way, with Malachi Corley (37%), Gage Larvadain (29%), and Isaiah Bond (29%) splitting the rest of the reps almost evenly again. In the offensive backfield, Jerome Ford (22%) narrowly returned to his RB2 duties, eking out rookie Dylan Sampson (19%) in the snap counts this week. Quinshon Judkins (60%) led the backfield, of course. Defense Despite not having a player hit 100% this week, the Browns' defense had six players who were on the field for more than 90% of the snaps: S Grant Delpit, LB Carson Schwesinger, and CB Tyson Campbell all played 63 snaps (94%), while S Ronnie Hickman and CB Denzel Ward hit 62 snaps (93%), and star defensive end Myles Garrett played a higher-than-usual 61 snaps (91%). Outside of Garrett, seven (!) more defensive linemen played over 30% of the Browns' defensive snaps, as ESPN's Daniel Oyefusi mentioned in the above post on X: DT Mason Graham (73%), DE Cam Thomas (57%), DT Shelby Harris (48%), DT Maliek Collins (39%), DE Isaiah McGuire (33%), DT Mike Hall Jr (33%), and DT Sam Kamara (30%). After being a key part of Cleveland's defensive line rotation on Sunday, Collins unfortunately suffered an apparent season-ending injury in the loss to the 49ers. McGuire, who had been the team's primary option at defensive end opposite of Garrett in Alex Wright's absence, trailed Thomas in snaps this week. Special teams Three Browns players tied for the team lead in special teams snaps this week with 15 snaps (71%): DE Cam Thomas, CB Myles Harden, and S Donovan McMillon. Easton Mascarenas-Arnold and Christopher Edmonds were also active often, playing 62%, while usual special teams participants in Hickman, Delpit, and tight end Blake Whiteheart also all played over 50% of Cleveland's special teams snaps.",

            "content": "War came to San Diego this past Saturday at WWE Survivor Series WarGames 2025, and while the fighting was furious, it's already nearly time to move on to the next battle! \"WWE Raw\" kicks off tonight and will feature a new combat zone one in which Dominik Mysterio is once again men's Intercontinental Champion and Bron Breakker can (and doubtless will) boast that he pinned the World Heavyweight Champion, though he did so after interference from a mysterious masked individual who is definitely Austin Theory. The women's division is also in flux after Liv Morgan's return, Stephanie Vaquer's lastest title defense, and AJ Lee making Becky Lynch tap out inside the fiendish double cage structure to win WarGames for her team. But how will WWE actually move forward in all these storylines (and perhaps others) as we enter the final month of 2025? That's what the Wrestling Inc. staff is here to tell you about. The smoke has cleared and the cannons have gone quiet, but where do we go from here? Read more: Every Paul Heyman Guy, Ranked By Accomplishments What will be the WarGames fallout for the women's division? Neon green chains, kendo sticks, and IYO SKY-branded trash cans litter the smoldering battlefield post-Women's WarGames, but even with a Team Rhea Ripley victory, the war is far from over, with plenty to predict post-Survivor Series. What's next for AJ Lee and Becky Lynch post-Black Widow tap-out? Will Charlotte Flair turn on Alexa Bliss, or will Bliss play backstabber? Just where is the ceiling for Lash Legend's momentous rise to fame? Is WarGames the end of the RHIYO/Kabuki Warriors rivalry? Just where do we go from here? Lee took home the victory for her WarGames team by submitting Lynch, and if Lynch's current character is anything to go by, she will not take the loss lying down. We are almost guaranteed a solo Lee and Lynch feud in the coming months, given that scheduling works out for both women. Expect a lot of cutthroat mic work between these two known chatterboxes, and a match that will have you rewriting the definition of \"in-ring storytelling.\" Some of us at Wrestling Inc. anticipated a Flair turn on Bliss following Flair's dramatic departure-and-reentry into Team Ripley, but that did not come to pass in San Diego. Even if Flair ultimately played nice with her WarGames teammates, we cannot forget Bliss' heartfelt, irate promo against her best friend immediately after Flair's initial WarGames refusal. Wounded trust like that doesn't dissipate overnight; there's little chance that Bliss will forget Flair's initial walk-out. It's not a matter of if. It's not even a matter of when. It's a matter of who will be the backstabber in the incoming Flair/Bliss fallout. Either women can play the dastardly heel, and with Uncle Howdy reappearing on \"WWE SmackDown,\" Bliss could easily fall victim to the demons in her mind. That is, if \"The Queen's\" ego doesn't beat her to the punch. Nia Jax has gold on her hands in the form of Legend, but if her past tenure with proteges like Tiffany Stratton are anything to go by, Legend could very well be on her way to leaving the nest. On the \"Raw\" side of things, this is probably the end of the RHIYO/Kabuki Warriors feud. While RHIYO didn't pin or submit Asuka or Kairi Sane, this feels like a good place to end things. Asuka and Sane need to put those titles up for grabs, and RHIYO need to look past them and to the future either as a unit, or as individuals. The ground is rumbling post-WarGames. Just who will capitalize on the leftovers of war is anyone's guess. Written by Angeline Phu How will Liv Morgan's return impact The Judgment Day? Liv Morgan is officially back on WWE programming and she returned in dramatic fashion at Survivor Series: WarGames to help her storyline boyfriend, Dominik Mysterio, regain the Intercontinental Championship from the legendary John Cena in his final premium live event match. We know exactly where things go for John Cena from here, he heads to Washington, DC to face his final opponent, determined through the \"Last Time is Now\" tournament (more than likely GUNTHER) at Saturday Night's Main Event, but where do the new Intercontinental Champion and his newly-returned girlfriend go from here? While Morgan may be back on television, she's hopefully also cleared for in-ring competition. That was hard to tell from her relatively simple interaction with Cena in the ring, she just hit him with a low blow after initially slapping Mysterio as a fake-out. If she's cleared, she's likely first going after Roxanne Perez to have her kicked out of The Judgment Day, even though Perez hasn't really been overtly flirty with Mysterio since Morgan was initially taken out of action. Raquel Rodriguez, turning on Perez, and Morgan could team up to get \"The Prodigy\" out of the group, and then move on a tag team to capture the Women's Tag Team Championships for a presumably record-setting fifth time. Many fans of Morgan thought her return was most likely to come at the Royal Rumble, so it's obvious that she will be one of the participants next year in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. She also has yet to win a Rumble match, but has been runner-up the last two years, so 2026 may very well be her year. Women's World Champion Stephanie Vaquer needs some credible challengers desperately, but she may have to wait until WrestleMania if Morgan wins the Rumble. Morgan has held that title twice, but has never faced off against Vaquer, and the first-time match-up would be big (and extremely marketable) on the \"The Grandest Stage of Them All.\" Despite winning the championship back, Mysterio looks most likely to head into a feud with his father, Rey Mysterio, in a match that may very well culminate at WrestleMania 42 in Las Vegas, though it could very well also be for the title. Rey returned to challenge his son, upset that the younger Mysterio was calling himself \"The King of the Luchadores\" at the beginning of November, and they have yet to go one-on-one. If WWE wanted to drag out the feud until 'Mania, it would be interesting to see Perez and Rey team up in a mixed tag match against Morgan and Mysterio at some point along the way. Mysterio also still holds the AAA Mega Championship, which could be something his father is also after. Written by Daisy Ruth Who will be Stephanie Vaquer's next world title challenger? WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella's forehead is still battered and bruised after taking multiple Devil's Kisses during Survivor Series Saturday, where she attempted to defeat Stephanie Vaquer for her WWE Women's World Championship. While Bella is nursing her wounds, however, Vaquer has ought to be looking towards the future, where a litany of competitors on the \"WWE RAW\" women's roster are available and ready for a title opportunity. Who will step up to \"La Primera?\" What is Bella left to do after her world title ambitions have gone up in smoke? With San Diego in the rear view mirror, where do we go from here? While Bella is not going to be in the world title picture any time soon, don't count her out of WWE just yet. Bella is an in-ring icon with, all things considered, plenty of gas left in the tank. I anticipate Bella will stick around on a part-time schedule, I imagine to feud with some newer faces in the business. Maybe Maxxine Dupri can continue to put her name on the map by standing toe-to-toe with a literal Hall of Famer. Maybe Bella can revisit old friends in the industry, with Bayley or Natalya being potential babyfaces to Bella's newly-revisited heel gimmick. If we're expanding Bella's horizons to tag team wrestling, she has mentioned feeling \"lonely\" without her sister Brie by her side. Could the Kabuki Warriors have new contenders for their WWE Women's Tag Team Championships? What Bella's next moves are post-title loss are unclear, but expect her to still be a \"Raw\" draw. If the sky is the limit for Nikki Bella's next \"Raw\" storyline, then the possibilities are literally endless for Vaquer's Women's World Championship reign. Vaquer has had a pretty muted world title reign thus far, only really defending the title against Raquel Rodriguez and Nikki in the first 70 days of her title reign. WWE needs to turn up the heat on \"La Primera's\" title contenders if her Women's World Championship reign is to be as memorable as any of her other championship runs, non-WWE titles included. Roxanne Perez has had a great few matches with Vaquer; the two of them could easily tear the house down at a \"Saturday Night's Main Event-\"type show, or in the main event of \"Raw.\" You could easily switch out Perez for any of \"Raw's\" underrated female talent, like Lyra Valkyria and Natalya. As for next premium live event challenger, however, there are a litany of headliners that Vaquer hasn't locked up with yet: Bayley, Becky Lynch, and Rhea Ripley are all without obvious directions post-Survivor Series. Who Vaquer will defend her title against next is unclear, but it needs to be big. Written by Angeline Phu Who does what after the Men's WarGames match? The main event of Survivor Series: WarGames was stacked with 10 of the roster's biggest names this past weekend, with the team of Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed, Logan Paul, Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar scoring the win over Roman Reigns, The Usos, WWE World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk, and WWE Champion Cody Rhodes. It took months of conflict between the parties involved, with Reigns and Punk at the center of the WrestleMania triple threat against Seth Rollins which birthed The Vision which Breakker, Reed, and Lesnar (on applicable days) are a part of. Rollins' vision for The Vision included the World Heavyweight title held at the time by Jey Uso, so naturally he was brought into the affair. Also, in case one was unaware, the Usos and Reigns are actual in-real-life cousins. It would've been criminal to have WarGames without a Rhodes when available, as well as the fact that Rollins and Vision beat him at Crown Jewel. McIntyre has been feuding with Rhodes for his title over the past few months, has well long-standing issues with Punk, Reigns and, by proxy, the Usos. But that was going into the affair. The question now sits with what on Earth happens moving forward. Well, Breakker was the one to get the pin on none other than Punk, putting him closer to anyone else in having a claim at his title. Breakker had been the one to pluck the title from the proverbial corpse of Rollins after he and Reed turned on him, later giving it up under Adam Pearce's duress so that Punk and Jey could fight for the title which Punk then won. It would be safe to assume that his pursuit of the title will be backed by Reed as well, and with Jey likely to be Punk's only full-time ally in the coming weeks, there is a chance Reed and Jey counter-act one another in said pursuit. Breakker's win was helped by the interference of a mystery masked individual, making use of Rollins' own curbstomp to leave Punk ripe for the taking. That individual has since been reported as Austin Theory, so maybe he joins the Vision and starts a tag team with Paul going forward? McIntyre has a win over Rhodes, albeit technically, and it would be a true surprise if he didn't try to use that to leverage another title shot. Reigns and Lesnar are the part-timers among the bunch, and while it's unknown when, where, and why they will be back (a truly Royal conundrum), Reigns did at least indicate he was not teaming with Rhodes ever again. And that certainly leaves the road open for a trilogy stop. Written by Max Everett Don't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

            "content": "The HP Omen Max 16 is one of the most impressive gaming laptops we've tested in 2025, and has since become a firm favorite. Thanks to the Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals that are happening right now, this offering just got a whole lot more appealing. There had already been an impressive $560 knocked off the price over the weekend, but now that discount has been increased to a commanding $685 to bring it down to just $2,474. 99 at Best Buy. Considering this is already a gaming laptop we highly recommend at a higher price, that makes it even more tempting. The sleek and streamlined design hides away an impressive selection of components under the hood, including an RTX 5080 GPU and an Intel Core Ultra 9 to keep things running smoothly, and in our benchmarking tests this set up performed exceedingly well. There's also a 16\" OLED screen running at 240Hz for crisp and bright visuals, while a 2TB SSD means you've got plenty of storage to work with. This is the best gaming laptop on the market in our books, but the clock is quickly ticking down on the Cyber Monday deal so you'll need to act fast if you want to take advantage of it. Should you buy the HP Omen Max 16? In our HP Omen Max 16 review, we highlighted it as one of the best models of the year and our go-to recommendation for a future-proofed system at a reasonable price a summation that has held up despite the more recent arrival of similar systems such as the Alienware 16 Area-51 and Lenovo Legion 5 Gen 10. There's a lot to like about the Omen Max 16, and although we reviewed the crisp White version the Shadow Black finish is just as sleek. HP have packed this offering into a smart form factor, making it easier to transport and less intrusive, while still giving the components room to breathe. Its performance is great, and the Omen Max 16 scored very highly on our benchmarking, behaving more like an RTX 5090 at times as it tore through various tests. Of course, the HP Omen Max 16 isn't completely without issues, and while we liked the appearance of the RGB keyboard we did feel parts of the full keyboard were a little squished and noticed an amount of flex in the deck not enough to feel spongy but a little disappointing for a premium build. There's also the battery to consider, as while this gaming laptop excels when plugged in, remove the power and performance drops significantly, while also giving you a little over an hour before reserves are completely drained. However, those issues aside, this is still our top recommendation for a gaming laptop in this price range, and with the generous discount currently applied it's even more appealing.

            "content": "Two weeks after Megabonk developer Vedinad withdrew the game from contention in the Best Debut Indie category at The Game Awards, it's back in the fight-not as a debut (or indie) game, but in the fan-voted Players' Voice category. \"WE'RE SO BACK,\" Vedinad screamed (virtually, of course) on X. \"Megabonk is nominated for The Game Awards-Player's Voice!! \"I withdrew my other nomination due to Megabonk not fitting the category, but with this new nomination we're more back than ever. go vote pls\" Initial nominations for The Game Awards in most categories are selected by \"an international jury of over 100 global media and influencer outlets,\" a group that includes PC Gamer. As detailed in The Game Awards FAQ, winners are selected by a \"blended vote\" that's 90% voting jury and 10% fan vote, a system that aims to avoid the inherent disadvantage of single-platform games as well as any potential 'social engineering' that could impact the outcome. But the Players' Voice category is separate from all that. It's 100% based on a public vote, beginning with a slate of 30 games and running through three rounds of voting until only one is left standing. And with all due respect, that's not great for Megabonk's chances. It was up against very tough competition to start with in the Best Debut Indie category, which includes Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the most-nominated game in TGA history. But now its odds are even longer-the full list of contenders include some of the biggest games of 2025 as well as perennially popular live service hits: Arc Raiders Battlefield 6 Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (it's everywhere) Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Delta Force Dispatch Donkey Kong Bananza Doom: The Dark Ages Elden Ring Nightreign Final Fantasy 14 Fortnite Genshin Impact Ghost of Yotei Hades 2 Helldivers 2 Hollow Knight: Silksong Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Mario Kart World Marvel Rivals Megabonk Ninja Gaiden 4 No Man's Sky Peak REPO Silent Hill f Sonic Racing: Crossworlds Split Fiction Warframe Wuthering Waves Anything can happen and I think it'd be great to see a dark horse come up the middle and steal gold, but this field is stacked. This is the one category where I think there's reasonable odds that Clair Obscur will come up short, but that still leaves obvious favorites like Arc Raiders, Silksong, and KC: D2 in the mix, not to mention Helldivers 2 and Fortnite, which can bring significant communities to bear on the voting effort. We'll find out how it goes in less than two weeks: The Game Awards 2025 takes place on December 11.",

The Sixers took a heartbreaking loss to the Atlanta Hawks in double overtime on Sunday and will now look to take advantage of a young and rebuilding Wizards team. As far as the injury report is concerned, the Sixers will, of course, be missing Kelly Oubre Jr. (left knee sprain) and Trendon Watford (left adductor strain) as the two versatile forwards continue to work their way back from their respective injuries. As for Joel Embiid, the big fella returned on Sunday against the Hawks after missing nine straight games with a bothersome right knee, and he played 30 minutes. He is listed as out against the Wizards due to right knee injury management. Andre Drummond (right knee contusion) and Paul George (left knee injury recovery, lower back tightness) are listed as questionable. Tip off from the Xfinity Mobile Arena is set for 7 p. m. EST on Tuesday with Philadelphia looking to get back in the win column and move forward.",

            "content": "The Washington Commanders took on the Denver Broncos in Week 13 on Sunday Night Football. The Broncos were a heavy favorite entering the contest, but the Marcus Mariota-led Commanders were able to give them a game. Thanks to a late drive that resulted in a field goal, the game went to overtime tied at 20. The Broncos scored a touchdown on their first drive in overtime, but the Commanders were able to respond with a score of their own. The person who caught that touchdown in overtime? None other than Terry McLaurin, who made his return in Week 13 after missing the last month of action. On the night, McLaurin caught seven passes for 96 yards and one score. The Broncos boast one of the toughest pass defenses in the league, and arguably the league's best cover corner in Patrick Surtain II. McLaurin was targeted eight times while Surtain was on him, and the receiver caught three of those. One of those three catches on Surtain was the touchdown in overtime. Prior to that, Surtain had not allowed a touchdown on his last 507 coverage snaps dating back to Week 13 of 2024. Being the first person to score on Surtain in a full year is an impressive feat, especially coming off an injury. The offense just has a different level to it when McLaurin and Deebo Samuel are both available. Unfortunately, McLaurin has only played in six games this year. The veteran has 20 catches for 299 yards and two scores so far on the season. The Commanders put up 419 total yards of offense, and Mariota threw for a season-high 294 yards in Week 13, but it still wasn't enough to upset the Broncos. Now, the Commanders will head into Week 14 against the Minnesota Vikings, and the hope is that Jayden Daniels can return soon.",

            "content": "Caitl Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here. The WNBA and the WNBPA on Sunday agreed to a 40-day extension of the current collective bargaining agreement. For the second time since the 2025 season came to an end, the league and the players' union agreed on extending the negotiation window to avoid what fans fear: a work stoppage that would alter the dynamic of the WNBA and slow the league's momentum. Though Caitlin Clark joining the Indiana Fever in 2024 was hardly the flashpoint event, the superstar point guard has been credited with introducing millions of new fans to the WNBA after those same fans saw her shatter NCAA scoring records at the University of Iowa. Now a two-time All-Star who endured an injury-riddled second season in the pros, Clark's WNBA future is of significant interest to fans -- and to the league, which reportedly just raised the stakes in these slow-moving talks. Salary cap to rise -- and million-dollar max salaries One day in to the 40-day CBA extension, the WNBA reportedly made a new offer to the WNBPA that could get the ball rolling in terms of advancing the gridlocked negotiations. ESPN among others reported that the WNBA is guaranteeing $1 million maximum salaries for 2026; the max salary in 2025 was set at $249,244. Under the new deal, the average salary would be roughly $500,000, while the minimum salary would increase to $225,000 from just over $66,000. This means that when Clark signs what many expect will be a max contract in 2027, she will be line for multimillion dollar deal that would break new ground in the WNBA. Perhaps crucially, the deal includes a revenue-sharing component that the players' union has been after since it opted out of the 2020 CBA last year. The league's salary cap would immediately jump to $5 million in 2026, and it would grow annually based on revenue growth in each year of the CBA. It is a departure from the current agreement, in which the 2025 salary cap was set at $1. 5 million, having grown at a fixed rate of three percent relative to the previous year. According to ESPN, it is \"unclear\" what players think of the new offer, or whether it will be enough to kickstart meaningful negotiations. But the WNBA has taken the first shot in this new, 40-day window, and only time will tell where talks go from here. More WNBA news:.",

            "content": "The Seattle Seahawks had a somewhat unclean performance against a bottom-dwelling opponent for the second week in a row. However, unlike last week’s 30-24 win over the lowly Tennessee Titans, the Seahawks didn’t have to be sharp across the board to easily handle the Minnesota Vikings. While the offense sputtered at times, the defense was sparkling and ruthless in shutting the Vikings offense down, clinching a 26-0 victory and a first shutout since the 2015 season. Let’s not lose sight of the fact that the Seahawks have won three straight home games and have already surpassed last year’s meager win total at Lumen Field. Getting more home games in January will surely have to involve winning their final two regular season home dates versus the Indianapolis Colts and especially the Los Angeles Rams. We’ll have plenty of time to dissect those matchups. What better way to start a December to remember than an Enemy Reaction? Daily Norseman is our source of opposition game thread goodness, and while we try and show positive opposition reactions to good plays by their team, this one was admittedly a little hard to pull off. Sam Darnold strip-sacked by Dallas Turner, Vikings recover (3-0 SEA) Max Brosmer commits Looney Tunes pick-six, Ernest Jones gets the TD (10-0 SEA) Aaron Jones fumbles the ball, Seahawks recover (13-0 SEA) Max Brosmer overthrows his man, Coby Bryant comes up with the pick (16-0 SEA) Ernest Jones gets his second interception (19-0 SEA) Zach Charbonnet scores Seattle’s only offensive touchdown (26-0 SEA) Riq Woolen picks off Max Brosmer, fumbles it right back to the Vikings (26-0 SEA) Drake Thomas sacks Brosmer on 4th down to preserve the shutout (26-0 SEA FINAL) Post-Game: Here’s the Ernest pick-6 again, but with Vikings radio voice Paul Allen Post-Game: The Vikings can’t run it back next year (Dustin Baker, Vikings Territory) The Vikings can’t realistically fire Adofo-Mensah because there’s almost no evidence that dismissing a general manager while keeping the head coach leads to organizational success. And moving on from O’Connell makes even less sense; if fired, he’d be hired immediately and almost certainly thrive elsewhere. It could mirror the mistake of letting Sam Darnold walk. Staying the course with McCarthy is its own gamble, because, without exaggeration, McCarthy has been one of the worst statistical quarterbacks in league history through six starts. He might simply be a miss, no different than Josh Rosen, Trey Lance, Zach Wilson, and other first-round quarterbacks who never developed. Busts happen. Keeping everything intact same front office, same coaching setup, same quarterback risks inviting a near-identical result in 2026 and drifting into the “definition of insanity” territory. As for signing a free-agent quarterback in March, that path is familiar. It’s the same method that brought Kirk Cousins to Minnesota, and any veteran available on the open market arrives with a limited ceiling. That’s precisely why the Vikings never reached a Super Bowl with Cousins or Darnold. Other teams let those quarterbacks leave for a reason, and the Vikings shouldn’t expect a different result by recycling the same formula. Post-Game: Max Brosmer not put in position to succeed (La Velle E. Neal III, Minneapolis Star-Tribune) He was asked to start a game on the road. Every road game has some sort of hostile forces awaiting. Seattle’s are like walking into a real-life Matrix, in a stadium designed with acoustics in mind, a decibel counter running for 60 minutes of play and 11 Agent Smiths lined up against him on every play. And the Vikings needed Brosmer to be Neo. Instead, Brosmer went 19-of-30 for 126 yards and four interceptions in the Vikings’ 26-0 pasting by Seattle. It is the Vikings’ first shutout loss since Nov. 11, 2007, when Green Bay ripped them apart 34-0 at Lambeau Field. The Purple’s quarterback that day was the affable Brooks Bollinger, who was 16-of-26 for 176 yards and only one interception. Even a middling performance under these circumstances, leading perhaps to a more competitive game, would have been a commendable achievement for Brosmer. Instead, it was a forgettable performance that, unfortunately for him, will be remembered for a while. Brosmer and the Vikings ran just 50 plays on Sunday, averaging 3. 2 yards. Post-Game Video: This is a new low for the Vikings (Purple FTW! Podcast) Enemy Reaction BONUS: LA Rams lose to Carolina Panthers! Enemy Preaction: Atlanta Falcons While the Seahawks still have a lot of work to do to win the NFC West and potentially the top seed in the conference, their path to a playoff berth is within touching distance thanks to taking care of the teams they’re supposed to take care of. There is a somewhat realistic path that could see them lock up a postseason spot before the Week 16 Rams rematch, which would at least ease any lingering concerns about some sort of collapse. I suppose for some who are still not over the first Rams game, it makes that loss sting harder knowing they could really be in control of the division right now. Up next are the Atlanta Falcons, who are 4-8 and sagging, but they have a pass rush that is finally fierce again. Unfortunately, in landing James Pearce Jr, they also gave the Rams next year’s first-round pick, so the Rams still found a way to win this weekend. Beating Atlanta only helps the Rams in April, but I don’t care about how the Rams will benefit in April. I care about winning in December to get home playoff games in January. If all breaks right, San Francisco 49ers fans could be tormented by Seattle’s presence on the field at Levi’s Stadium in February. At this point, with no clearly super dominant team in either conference, why shouldn’t Seahawks fans believe a deep run is possible? Thanks for reading and go ‘Hawks!.",

            "content": "By Mar-Vic Cagurangan A ranking military official said Guam needs to build a new hospital that will serve both the civilian and the military communities, “especially in times of conflict or natural disasters where we need to really have a structure that can address the challenges of mass casualties.” “So, there is an agreement about the necessity of a new hospital, as our current hospital cannot meet the demands,” Hung Cao, undersecretary of the Navy and senior military official Guam, said after meeting with Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero during his visit in October. Cao said financing will be the subject of negotiations and the question is, “Where will the funding come from and so forth?” It is an open-ended question. On the home front, the governor's plan to build a new medical campus in Mangilao is riddled with polarizing questions and legal challenges. There is a lingering debate over the hospital site. And there is a policy clash: Should Guam build a new medical facility or invest in rehabilitating Guam Memorial Hospital? Most recently, the proposed project hit a new snag when Superior Court Judge Elyze M. Iriarte struck down the Guam Housing and Urban Renewal Authority's move to condemn the Mangilao properties designated as the hospital project site. Iriarte pointed out that the proposed plan for the target land does not legally justify an exercise of eminent domain. She noted concerns, previously raised by other courts, that \"a grant of the power of eminent domain is one of the attributes of sovereignty most fraught with the possibility of abuse and injustice.” The court's decision subsequently prompted the 38th Guam Legislature to reject the governor's proposed bill authorizing the Guam Power Authority and the Guam Waterworks Authority to spend Guam's remaining $104 million in American Rescue Act funds on the development of utility infrastructure on the marked project site. “Despite the continuous assertions coming out of Adelup, nothing is preventing the construction of a new hospital at a wide range of potential sites across our island,\" Speaker Frank Blas Jr. said. \"The narrative that only one site is feasible has now been thoroughly discredited by sworn testimony.\" Blas said the property acquisition \"raises serious legal and procedural concerns about the entire effort undertaken by the governor’s office.” He said the legislature should not intervene in any legal dispute between the governor and the attorney general, especially when those disputes are currently being resolved within the Judicial branch of our island’s government. “With such large amounts of federal funds at stake, it is imperative that due diligence be given (by the attorney general, by the courts, and by the legislature and that the default move should not be to try to remove the referee with minutes left on the clock just because one team doesn’t like how he does his job,” he added. Leon Guerrero, for her part, maintained that the administration \"has done everything required-legally, procedurally and in good faith. We answered the questions. We revised the bill. We complied with the law. But we cannot comply with silence. We cannot comply with obstruction.\" Sen. Sabrina Salas Matanane, chair of the health committee, said choosing the best location for a new medical facility must be based on merits-argued and processed by experts and the medical community-not political pressure. \"I don’t want to be bullied into supporting a bill that is less about literal power for the people of Mangilao and more about power to circumvent legal review,\" she said. In Adelup, the governor slammed the legislature’s rejection of her bill. “When leaders refuse to act in a moment that demands action, when they choose delay over duty, when they stand still while the needs of the people grow-that is not oversight. That is abandonment. And that is what happened here,” she said. “Now we wait for their plan-their plan to save this money under federal rules, their plan to build the hospital they say they support.”.",

Cooke, 30, was at the center of several scuffles during the Jaguars’ 25-3 win over the Titans on Sunday, being knocked over twice by late hits after punting the ball and then later being blocked hard by Chestnut, 25, on a 47-yard punt return by Chimere Dike in the fourth quarter. After Dike’s 47-yard return, the Jaguars punter received an unnecessary roughness penalty following a scuffle involving several other players. Chestnut told reporters after the game that at some point during Sunday’s contest, Cooke got in his face and “said he was going to kill” him. “I was just trying to play hard, and he came up to me and said he was going to kill me,” Chestnut said, slightly smiling as he retold the story about the punter’s aggressive message to him. “So I don’t know what made him do that.” Chestnut reporters he never got an explanation for what exactly irked Cooke enough to make the alleged threat, according to the Associated Press. PEOPLE has contacted the Jaguars for comment. \"That was surprising to me,” Chestnut added. “I ain't never seen nothing like that before.” After the game, Cooke spoke with reporters but wasn’t specifically asked about the incident. He was, however, asked about his scuffles with Titans players and an elongated conversation he had with a referee following one of those incidents. \"I might have said some things that sounded rude, so I wanted to go clear the air,\" Cooke told reporters about the conversation with the referee after halftime, according to video shared online by local CBS 47. \"I don't like people having grudges against me, so [I was] kind of telling him the situation and also [wanted to] find out his take on what happened on that play in the end zone.\" Cooke said Sunday’s win over the Titans was an “eventful” game and admitted that “in the moment” he can “get very upset about certain calls. “But it is what it is,” Cooke said. “You can’t hold that against them.” Jaguars coach Liam Coen said at his postgame press conference that he’d like to see Cooke play “smarter” going forward. “There were some frustrations being built up with them rushing us the way they were,” Coen said. “I’m proud of those guys for competing, but we’ve got to continue to be smarter.”.",

            "content": "DETROIT (AP) Two conservative political operatives were sentenced to probation Monday for a scheme to discourage Black Detroit voters from voting by mail in the 2020 presidential election, the last court hearing in a multistate effort to blast thousands of robocalls. Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman were accused of creating robocalls that warned people they could be hounded by police, debt collectors and government vaccine bureaucrats if they voted by mail. Authorities said the bogus messages targeted urban areas that typically vote Democratic. “Don’t be finessed into giving your private information to the man,” a recorded voice said. In August, Wohl and Burkman pleaded no contest to voter intimidation, conspiracy and computer crimes after a long, unsuccessful effort to challenge the charges on free speech grounds. A Wayne County judge sentenced them to a year of probation. Wohl and Burkman “used every racist dog whistle” to discourage people from voting by mail, said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat. Wohl and Burkman were also pursued for robocalls in New York and Ohio. An Ohio judge in 2022 ordered them to perform 500 hours of community service related to voter registration in Washington, records show. In New York, they settled a lawsuit last year by agreeing to pay up to $1. 25 million, the attorney general’s office said. Defense attorneys in the Michigan case said Wohl and Burkman were ready to move on. “I don’t think he’s going to be back in any court in the future,” said Burkman’s lawyer, Scott Grabel, who acknowledged the robocalls were offensive. Attorney William Amadeo said he’s glad Wohl “can put it behind him.”.",

            "content": "The White House used New York Times reporter Katie Rogers' own words to smack down her \"fatigue\" claim about President Donald Trump's health during his second term. At the White House press briefing on Monday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed out how rich it was to read Roger's NYT piece about Trump, given she was the exact same reporter at the same outlet who wrote several pieces praising failing former President Joe Biden's \"vigorous\" health during his presidency. READ MORE: Healthcare Overhaul: Trump Now Urging Congress to Send Obamacare Money Directly to Taxpayers Trump Just Released His MRI Results Please Keep the Media in Your Thoughts and Prayers \"One fake news story over the weekend, before I let you all go, from the New York Times that took about one-third of the president's daily calendar and his daily schedule, and said that 'he's doing less than he did in his first term or he might not be fit for the job,' that is unequivocally false,\" Leavitt said. \"And it's deeply unfortunate that this story was written by the same outlet and the same reporter who wrote this,\" she added, as she held up a copy of Rogers' NYT piece, \"Biden is doing 100 percent fine after tripping while boarding Air Force One. Same outlet, same reporter who wrote that President Trump is not fit for the job,\" Leavitt continued. \"Are you kidding me? \"Another one [article], 'Biden declared 'healthy' and 'vigorous' after this first presidential physical.' Hmmm, I don't see headlines like that too often about this president. Again, same reporter, same outlet, who wrote falsely over the weekend that President Trump is not fit for the job. I can assure you, he absolutely is.\" She closed her comments by pointing to the three different detailed reports from the White House showing President Trump in great health. SEE: White House Shares Positive Update on Trump's MRI Sorry, Dems: President Trump Is in Great Health Later, during the briefing, the White House was asked about the new media bias website it released over the weekend, pointing out fake news and headlines about Trump and the administration, as my RedState colleague Ward Clark reported. Leavitt made it clear that the WH will absolutely name the outlets that have reported false news and the correspondents/reporters who wrote the pieces, \"much to the dismay\" of some in the briefing room. \"It goes to our original promise on Day One to hold the media accountable,\" Leavitt said. \"Because unfortunately, and we deal with this all day, every day around here, there are so many fake stories that are unfortunately written. That have inaccurate characterizations of meetings that took place, and it's all based on anonymous sourcing,\" she added. \"And the standard for journalism, unfortunately, has dropped to such a historic low in this country. And again we deal with this every day,\" Leavitt continued. \"Where you can have an anonymous source who has no idea what they're talking about, zero credibility, call up a reporter in Washington and say 'Hey, I heard this.' And then the next thing you know, it's on the front page of the New York Times. It's really incomprehensible.\" Here's that website if you want to check it out for yourself, which reads, \"Misleading. Biased. Exposed.\" And includes all the receipts from the White House that dispute the claims with facts.

            "content": "I've been an avid Steam Deck user since Valve released the handheld three years ago and, over the years, I've discovered there are some accessories that you can't do without. For anyone searching for the best Cyber Monday gaming deals for their Deck, I'd always recommend looking for a microSD, and the good news is that this year, my favorite (the Samsung PRO Plus 1TB microSD) is now discounted by 33%. In terms of the best all-rounder when it comes to Steam Deck microSD cards, the Samsung PRO Plus is the best out there. Carrying on from its price cut last week as part of the best Black Friday Steam Deck deals, the card is now $79. 99 compared to its normal price of $119. 99. Not only does it offer 1TB of additional space to store your games, but it has a very respectable read and write speeds of 180MB/s meaning faster launch times and great performance as well. Should you buy the Samsung PRO Plus microSD? One of the Steam Deck's biggest issues is storage. To really get the most out of your handheld, you're going to need to get a microSD card at some point. And after years of trying different sizes and having to upgrade again and again, I can personally say that getting a 1TB option will save you time and money in the future. Games are getting bigger and more demanding, and the Samsung PRO Plus microSD is one of the few on the market that offers 1TB at all. Not only will you get more storage with the Samsung PRO Plus, but it also has a U3 rating (Ultra-High Speed Class 3) with read and write speeds of 180MB/s. So, it's an industry standard and very trustworthy as well. In terms of speed, the only microSD that I say ranks ahead of the Samsung PRO Plus is the SanDisk Extreme Pro, and there are currently no sales for a 1TB option on Amazon for that right now. So yeah, the Samsung PRO Plus is currently the best microSD deal for the Steam Deck this Cyber Monday, and honestly, I can't recommend it enough. The only thing to really consider before picking it up is that we have seen it go for even cheaper in the past. Back in October this year, it was discounted to $69. 99, beating this event's $79. 99. Personally, I think the discount is still very much worth it, but you may want to consider holding off for now if you want to try and get the absolutely lowest price for this one.

            "content": "A non custodial wallet is a type of crypto wallet where users hold their own private keys. In simple terms, this means that only the owner of the wallet can access and control their funds. No company or platform has permission to move or freeze the assets. As more people and businesses explore cryptocurrency, the conversation around digital security and privacy continues to grow. One tool that stands out in this discussion is the non custodial wallet. This type of wallet gives users full control over their digital assets without relying on a centralized service. With rising interest in Web3 technology, non custodial wallets are becoming a preferred choice for many individuals and organizations. What Is a Non Custodial Wallet? A non custodial wallet is a type of crypto wallet where users hold their own private keys. In simple terms, this means that only the owner of the wallet can access and control their funds. No company or platform has permission to move or freeze the assets. This is different from custodial wallets, where a third-party service usually an exchange stores the private keys on behalf of the user. While custodial options may seem convenient, they also require users to trust the platform with their digital assets. Non custodial wallets remove this dependency and give full ownership back to the user. How a Non Custodial Wallet Works A non custodial wallet generates a private key and stores it locally on the user’s device. This key proves ownership of the crypto assets and allows the user to sign transactions. The workflow is simple: The wallet creates a private key unique to the user. The key is stored locally and never shared with any external server. When making a transaction, the wallet uses this key to sign and authorize it. The blockchain verifies the transaction and updates the balance. Because no central authority manages the funds, users remain fully responsible for their own assets and recovery phrases. Key Benefits of a Non Custodial Wallet Non custodial wallets offer several important advantages: 1. Full Control Over Assets Users can send, receive and store cryptocurrency without depending on any third-party service. 2. Higher Level of Privacy Since the private keys are held by the user, there is no need for platforms to store sensitive information. 3. Reduced Risk of Freezing or Blocked Funds No centralized service can restrict access to the wallet. 4. Better Alignment With Decentralization This type of wallet matches the original purpose of blockchain technology individual ownership. 5. Useful for Web3 Applications Many decentralized platforms require or recommend using non custodial wallets for secure authentication. These benefits explain why more users are choosing this option for both personal and business use. BitHide as an Example of a Non Custodial Wallet Solution One example of a platform offering this type of wallet is BitHide. BitHide provides a non custodial wallet system designed for users who want more privacy and direct control over their assets. Because the wallet is non custodial, BitHide does not store private keys or access user funds. BitHide supports a range of cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB and TRX. It also includes features useful for both individuals and companies, such as multi-wallet creation, mass payouts and API integration. These tools make it easier to integrate non custodial wallet functionality into websites, apps or payment systems. Another key advantage is that BitHide works without KYC requirements, which aligns with the principles of decentralized ownership and privacy. How Non Custodial Wallets Are Used in Real Situations Non custodial wallets can be helpful in many different areas: For Individual Users People use them to store their investments securely and maintain full control over their private keys. For Businesses Companies may integrate non custodial wallets into their platforms to: accept cryptocurrency payments, manage multiple wallets, automate payouts, build custom Web3 features. This gives businesses flexibility while avoiding the risks linked to custodial systems. For Web3 Platforms Decentralized applications often require non custodial wallets for logging in, signing actions and managing digital identity. This allows users to interact securely without giving up control. How Non Custodial Wallets Compare to Custodial Wallets Custodial wallets are generally more beginner-friendly, since a company manages the keys. However, they also introduce risks: funds may be frozen, withdrawal limits may apply, the platform may be hacked, user data may be exposed. With a non custodial wallet, these risks are significantly reduced. Users gain more control, although they must take responsibility for storing their private keys safely. Conclusion The growing interest in privacy, security and decentralization has made the non custodial wallet an important tool for crypto users and businesses. It allows individuals to maintain control over their assets and helps companies build more flexible Web3 infrastructure. Platforms like BitHide show how non custodial wallet technology can be integrated into modern digital services, offering a balance between usability, privacy and independence. As blockchain adoption continues to expand, non custodial wallets are likely to remain one of the fundamental tools in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

            "content": "When Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he believes the team's defense can do \"historic things,\" this probably isn't what he meant. Against the Bills on Sunday, the Steelers allowed 249 rushing yards to the Buffalo Bills. It was the most rushing yards allowed by the Steelers at home in 50 years. It happened on September 28, 1975. It was the home opener, the first game in Pittsburgh after the Steelers put the Vikings in a stranglehold for a 16-6 win in Super Bowl IX. And that game also involved the Bills. O. J. Simpson had 227 rushing yards that day. Jim Braxton added 80. In all, Buffalo shredded the Steel Curtain for 310 rushing yards, in a 30-21 win. The Steelers rebounded from that embarrassment, losing only one more game the rest of the season before beating Dallas in Super Bowl X. That same outcome to the 2025 season is extremely unlikely at this point. The playoffs currently feel like a long shot. Said linebacker T. J. Watt, after the 26-7 loss that dropped the Steelers to 6-6: “I’ve never seen a team run the same play that much and have that kind of success.” It speaks to the depths of the hole the Steelers have dug for themselves. Fans were chanting, \"Fire Tomlin!\" They booed during Renegade. Given the uncharacteristic, all-in moves made by the Steelers in an effort to win a playoff game for the first time since the 2016 season, it was the low point of the season. And it can get lower. They face the Ravens on Sunday, in Baltimore. The Steelers have a home game on December 15, against the Dolphins. They may not have to worry about chants or boos that night. They have to worry about the fans not showing up.",

            "content": "Nico O’Reilly says he feels he’s getting better every time he takes to the pitch for City. Men's Team How can I watch Fulham v City on TV? The 20-year-old has enjoyed a sparkling 2025 personally, playing 35 times since the turn of the year and becoming a key part of Pep Guardiola’s plans. Having spent more than a decade in our Academy playing predominantly in midfield, O’Reilly has taken incredibly well to his left-back berth in the first team. Buy your O’Reilly shirt here The No. 33 says himself he had never played in the role before the January FA Cup clash with Salford City but less than a year on, he appears a natural. So much so, he’s even earned his first two England caps in the position. Speaking ahead of Tuesday night’s trip to Fulham, O’Reilly reflected on his rise to this point. “I think I’m improving massively,” he began. “Game by game. It’s not just a traditional left-back, it’s more complicated. Men's Team City Magazine: December issue now available to read! “I’m going inside, going to the wing, getting into the box, defending as a back four and keeping a high line. “There’s so much going into it and very tactical. It’s quite a demanding position, there’s a lot of running up and down the flank. I’m enjoying it and I feel like I’m improving every game. CHRISTMAS, TOGETHER “I feel I understand the tactics and have always been quite clever on the pitch but it’s definitely a challenge because it’s a much higher level than previously.” O’Reilly has already made some of his dreams come true in 2025 but the Manchester-born star is well aware there’s plenty more hard work to come. Having seen such a dramatic change in his life this year, he insists he’s doing everything he can to take it all in his stride. “I’m really enjoying it. It’s mad because I never thought I’d be in this position so soon,” he said. “I’m trying to stay level-headed and stay off social media. I want to stay calm. “There’s a lot of outside noise but at the end of the day none of that matters, it’s what happens on the pitch that matters the most.” O’Reilly’s natural energy and athleticism sees him get up the pitch regularly in every game, where he has formed an understanding with Erling Haaland. Whether it’s crossing from deep or picking him out from the byline, O’Reilly feels he knows exactly the kind of service the prolific Norwegian is looking for. “Erling’s a top, top player and I know he’s always going to be there,” said O’Reilly. “When I’m putting the crosses in, whether it’s standing up to the back post, cutting it back, as soon as I look up and see a little movement I know where he’s going so I’ll put it there and he does the rest. “His movement’s so good that he can go anywhere. He can jump so high, he’s so fast in behind, so having a striker like that is so important.” Christmas Together Manchester City along with the Club’s charity, City in the Community, is uplifting the physical and mental health of patients, their parents/guardians, and siblings at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital (RMCH) this Christmas and into 2026.

Foden’s brilliant brace against Leeds at the weekend not only helped seal a crucial 3-2 Premier League win but also maintained the England international’s stellar form across the season to date. At the age of 25, the attacking midfielder is now entering what promises to be the prime years of a career that has already delivered so much since he first emerged on the senior scene as a teenager back in 2017. And addressing the media at his pre-match press conference ahead of Tuesday night’s latest league trip to Fulham, the City boss said he saw no reason why Foden’s influence wouldn’t continue to further grow looking to the long term. BUY YOUR FODEN #47 SHIRT “Hopefully he can stay all his career here. He’s a special player, a Man City fan from the Academy, there are no doubts on that,” Guardiola said. “[In terms of becoming a captain] If he wants to become one, yeah. “But captains come from themselves and their behaviour on and off the pitch.

He’s not a guy to talk much in the dressing room but on the pitch, he never hides behind the scenes or what’s going on. “He always took responsibility from day one, he has an incredible presence on the pitch.” That Leeds double took Foden’s tally of goals in all competitions this season to six. And for the boss, such is Foden’s quality and eye for an opportunity, he said he saw no reason why he couldn’t go on and look to approach 20 goals across the campaign in total to help boost City’s quest for success. “He’s done it in the past,” Pep pointed out. Men's Team O’Reilly: I think I’m improving game by game “The year we won the last Premier League title and made it four in a row he was the best player. “I don’t know how many goals he scored but he had a lot. “The success isn’t just the strikers but especially the wingers and attacking midfielders “Gundo [Ilkay Gundogan] scored a lot of goals in our Treble year, so we need that.” fulham v city app coverage Our official Man City app allows you to follow all of the action in one place.

            "content": "Pep Guardiola has speculated on what the future could hold for Manchester City’s Phil Foden, with the star’s contract nearing its end. Just 18 months remain on the 25-year-old’s current deal with the club. “You’re right. Completely right,” City’s boss answered when asked if he would like to keep hold of the attacker for many years to come. “A special player, Man City fan, from the Academy. No doubt about that.” Asked about current discussions on a contract extension for the Englishman, Guardiola claimed to be out of the loop. “No idea, but hopefully he is going to stay for all of his career here. “But I don’t know him, his agent, the club. I don’t know.” Foden earned the praise of his manager on Saturday, after scoring twice against Leeds United. It was his injury-time winner that moved City up to second in the Premier League table. After the match, the 25-year-old commented that he now feels like more of a leader within the team. In response, Guardiola insisted: “On the pitch, he always has been like that. “Vocally, he is not a guy who talks much in the dressing room, but on the pitch he never hides behind the scenes and never hides behind what’s going on. “He always took responsibility from day one. He always has been an incredible presence on the pitch.” Foden rose through City’s academy and has since made over 300 appearances for his boyhood club, establishing himself as one of the best players in the world. On the prospect of him one day captaining the side, Guardiola said: “If he wants to, yeah. “If he wants to become captain yeah. But in the end, the captains became captains from themselves, from their behaviour on and off the pitch. So it depends on him.”.",

The New York Giants' offense was dealt a pair of devastating blows earlier this season when the team lost wide receiver Malik Nabers and running back Cam Skattebo to significant injuries. Skattebo, who provided a major spark once he was given more opportunities, suffered a dislocated ankle in Week 8, while Nabers was diagnosed with a torn ACL after hurting himself in Week 4. It's always bad news to lose promising young players to injuries, but that's especially true in this instance because their injuries make rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart's job more difficult. So, will the Giants get either young player back this season? Here's what we know. Will Cam Skattebo return in 2025? No, Skattebo won't play for the rest of the season, as his injury is a season-ending issue. The good news is, Skattebo should be ready to go by the start of the 2026 season, at the latest, after undergoing successful surgery. In the meantime, the Giants have been deploying fellow running back Tyrone Tracy as the starter, and veteran rusher Devin Singletary has been the RB2. Will Malik Nabers return in 2025? No, Nabers won't return from his injury this season, either. A torn ACL is a season-ending injury and the recovery timeline for that issue is usually nine months, barring any setbacks. That means Nabers will be ready to roll by the start of next season if all goes well. With Nabers sidelined, veteran wideout Wan'Dale Robinson is posting career-best numbers. The former second-round pick has a career-high 794 receiving yards and three touchdowns. He needs one more score to set a new personal best. Robinson's career-best year comes at the perfect time, as he's slated to be a free agent in 2026. More NFL News.",

            "content": "Dozens of supporters gathered outside a Manhattan courthouse Monday morning, lining up in freezing temperatures for a chance to see Luigi Mangione, the 27-year-old Maryland native accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Midtown sidewalk one year ago, as reported by The New York Post. Some attendees wore outfits resembling the Luigi character from the Super Mario franchise, continuing a pattern seen at each of Mangione’s court appearances over the past year. Mangione, who comes from a wealthy Maryland family, has drawn sustained attention from a group of followers who routinely attend his hearings. Court officials said crowds began forming hours before the scheduled appearance. One supporter, Jonathan Garthrelle, 36, from Jamaica, Queens, said he attended because of concerns about how defendants are treated. “We are living in a time of rampant human-rights violations. We’re seeing it left and right. If they can violate the rights of an attractive white male, what hope do the rest of us have?” he said while waiting outside. This Could Be the Most Important Video Gun Owners Watch All Year Another attendee, 29-year-old personal chef Jasmin Flores of East Harlem, said she spent $150 on an Uber to ensure she arrived early. “It’s important for me to be here because he’s innocent,” she said. Mangione has been recorded on surveillance video near the crime scene and was later found with the firearm prosecutors allege was used in the killing. Several supporters said they were unable to get inside the courtroom due to limited seating. Tickets were distributed to those in line, and the cutoff was set at 24. Alexa Modugno, 35, of Manhattan, said she missed the threshold. “I was two tickets away,” she said. “I’m just here to support Luigi and fight against stigma against mental-health issues.” Mangione has gained a substantial online following, and supporters have raised more than $1. 3 million toward his legal expenses. Some who have aligned themselves with his cause claim they have been mistreated by the U. S. health-care system. Trucks displaying billboards with the names and photos of individuals described by supporters as victims of the industry were expected to appear outside the courthouse Monday. The hearing comes as Mangione’s defense team seeks to prevent prosecutors from presenting certain evidence to jurors. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office intends to introduce items seized during Mangione’s arrest on Dec. 4, 2024, at a McDonald’s restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Those items include a 9mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the weapon used in Thompson’s killing, as well as a notebook in which Mangione allegedly outlined plans to “wack” a health-insurance executive. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal murder charges. Additional pretrial proceedings are expected as both sides prepare for trial.",

            "content": "A 20-year-old Florida resident was arrested over the weekend after authorities said he posted a video on TikTok threatening a school shooting as part of an attempt to generate online reactions, as reported by The New York Post. The Walton County Sheriff’s Office announced the arrest of Ethan Ladner of Santa Rosa Beach on Sunday, charging him with making electronic threats of a mass shooting. According to the sheriff’s office, the investigation began after the FBI flagged the video, which had been uploaded to TikTok and later removed from the platform. Authorities said Ladner admitted to posting the comments that appeared in the clip and acknowledged that he had intended to provoke responses online. This Could Be the Most Important Video Gun Owners Watch All Year “Ladner admitted to posting the threatening comments and said he was attempting to provoke reactions online,” the Walton County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. The agency emphasized that all threats directed at schools are treated as credible until proven otherwise. “Let us be clear. There is no such thing as a ‘joke’ when it comes to threats of violence toward our schools,” the sheriff’s office said. The statement noted that “even comments made ‘as a joke’ can result in criminal charges, school discipline, and long-term consequences that follow someone for life.” Local authorities stressed that investigations involving school-related threats are handled with urgency, regardless of how the individual responsible characterizes their actions. Officials did not identify a specific school referenced in the video and did not release further details about the nature of the threat. The sheriff’s office confirmed only that the video had been taken down shortly after it was reported. Ladner is facing a felony charge under Florida law pertaining to electronic communications that threaten a mass shooting or act of terrorism. Authorities said the case remains under investigation and additional information will be released as it becomes available. The arrest comes amid broader concerns among law enforcement agencies nationwide about threats circulated on social media platforms. The Walton County Sheriff’s Office reiterated its policy of pursuing criminal charges in cases involving school-related threats, regardless of the intent stated by the person involved. Ladner was taken into custody without incident. No additional arrests have been announced, and authorities have not disclosed whether Ladner has obtained legal representation.",

In a statement shared with Fox News, Melania Trump said the theme was inspired by the meaning of home throughout different stages of her life. “The saying ‘Home is Where the Heart is’ resonates deeply with me, especially as I navigate the joys, challenges, and frequent motion that comes with motherhood and business,” she said. “The constant movement has taught me that home is not merely a physical space; rather, it is the warmth and comfort I carry within, regardless of my surroundings.” “This Christmas, let’s celebrate the love we hold within ourselves and share it with the world around us,” she added. “After all, wherever we are, we can create a home filled with grace, radiance, and endless possibilities.” According to the White House, more than 25, 000 feet of ribbon, over 2, 000 strands of lights, more than 2, 800 gold stars, over 10, 000 blue butterflies, and more than 700 feet of garland are included in the 2025 displays. This Could Be the Most Important Video Gun Owners Watch All Year Each detail was selected by the first lady to reflect the theme and highlight American traditions. One of the key highlights is in the Red Room, where historic cranberry trees, long associated with former First Lady Nancy Reagan, are featured. Red was also Reagan’s favorite color. The room includes a focus on Melania Trump’s “Fostering the Future” initiative, which aims to support children in the foster care system. Herve Pierre, described by the White House as the first lady’s “creative artist,” said the butterfly motif was chosen to represent “renewal, resilience, and new beginnings for the foster care community.” He noted that “the blue butterfly was the perfect choice to fulfill Mrs. Trump’s creative vision for her Christmas-themed Be Best Room” and said the addition of thousands of butterflies creates “a vibrant and festive atmosphere that reflects the first lady’s style.” A statement provided to ABC News said, “In every community, we are lifted by simple acts of kindness that reflect the enduring American spirit of generosity, patriotism, and gratitude. These moments remind us that the heart of America is strong and that Home Is Where The Heart Is.” The State Dining Room features the annual White House gingerbread house, constructed from 120 pounds of gingerbread. “It is edible, but you cannot take a piece with you,” Nick Clemens, spokesperson for the first lady, told USA Today. The East Room incorporates a patriotic décor with eagle ornaments and red, white, and blue decorations. The organization America250, which focuses on commemorating the nation’s upcoming semiquincentennial, issued a statement praising the display. “We are deeply honored that America250 is represented in this year’s White House holiday celebration,” a representative said. “The decor and concept of the East Room highlights ‘America, Our Home,’ beautifully reflecting the spirit of unity, hope, and shared purpose that defines our nation.” The representative added that the coming year offers an opportunity “to reflect on what connects us as Americans” while looking ahead “to the many ways we’ll come together in the year ahead to honor our past, celebrate our present, and imagine our collective future.” White House tours showcasing the Christmas decorations will begin on Tuesday.",

            "content": "A three-judge panel on the 3rd U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that Alina Habba, who previously served as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, was unlawfully installed as U. S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, as reported by The Gateway Pundit. The decision, released Monday, upholds a lower court ruling that found the administration did not follow the required appointment process after Senate confirmation efforts stalled. According to the opinion, the court determined that the administration’s reliance on a sequence of internal maneuvers to place Habba in the role did not meet constitutional requirements. The panel wrote that “under the Government’s delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U. S. Attorney indefinitely,” concluding that such an interpretation “bypasses the constitutional (appointment and Senate confirmation) process entirely.” The ruling follows months of litigation stemming from objections first raised by an Obama-appointed district judge who stated Habba was “not lawfully holding the office of United States Attorney.” Attorney General Pam Bondi filed an appeal shortly afterward, bringing the matter before the 3rd Circuit. Monday’s decision is the second in two weeks affecting Trump-administration U. S. Attorney appointments. This Could Be the Most Important Video Gun Owners Watch All Year Last week, a separate appeals panel ruled that Lindsey Halligan, the U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, had also been improperly appointed. That decision resulted in the dismissal of multiple cases involving former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The developments have renewed attention on the Senate confirmation process and the long-standing “blue slip” practice, a Senate custom that allows senators to block federal nominations in their home states. The administration has criticized the practice, arguing it gives Democratic senators unilateral power to stop presidential selections for U. S. Attorney positions. President Trump addressed the issue in an August post on X, writing, “I have a Constitutional Right to appoint Judges and U. S. Attorneys, but that RIGHT has been completely taken away from me in States that have just one Democrat United States Senator.” He added that the “old and outdated ‘custom’ known as a BLUE SLIP” has prevented qualified nominees from advancing, stating that Democratic lawmakers “have done so on numerous occasions” while Republican senators have continued observing the tradition. President Trump also criticized Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, saying Grassley’s adherence to the blue slip process has allowed only Democratic candidates to move through confirmations for key positions. “Chuck Grassley should allow strong Republican candidates to ascend to these very vital and powerful roles, and tell the Democrats, as they often tell us, to go to HELL!” he wrote. With the 3rd Circuit’s ruling now in effect, the status of ongoing cases in the District of New Jersey will be reviewed as the administration determines the next steps for filling the vacancy.",

            "content": "The U. S. Department of Justice lists the top prosecutor position in Vermont as vacant, but the person who has been running that office for nearly a year said he is running the show. The situation in Vermont is not unique, and has led to confusion and court cases around the country regarding who is legally carrying out federal law. Michael Drescher a longtime federal prosecutor in Vermont has held the post of acting U. S. attorney for Vermont since President Donald Trump took office in January. U. S. attorneys are responsible for prosecuting federal crimes and immigration law as well as representing the United States in civil matters. Drescher’s title changed from “acting” last month but he wasn’t named to the U. S. attorney post on a permanent basis by Trump, which would have required Senate confirmation. Instead, Drescher is listed as “First Assistant U. S. Attorney” in press releases issued by his office. In an email to VTDigger, Drescher stated, “I am still leading the office.” He did not respond to a followup email seeking answers to why the change was made, or who made the decision. The U. S. Department of Justice, headed by U. S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, did not respond to a request for comment. “There is a lot of confusion around the use of ‘interim,’ ‘acting’ and ‘first assistant’,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who tracks U. S. attorney and judicial nominations. “From my perspective, it’s avoiding what the Constitution requires, which is advice and consent of the Senate,” he said of the naming of U. S. attorneys. “In Trump 2. 0 they’ve played fast and loose with that, and this is another example of it.” Tobias said it’s difficult to say for certain why Trump doesn’t simply nominate a U. S. attorney for Vermont and go through the U. S. Senate confirmation process. It’s possible, Tobias said, that the president doesn’t want to go through that process or fears that nominee’s confirmation wouldn’t be successful, or that he hasn’t found someone he wants to formally name to the post permanently. Tobias said he also didn’t know the exact number of times during the Trump administration that an acting U. S. attorney for a federal district has later been named first assistant U. S. attorney to lead an office. “I can’t tell you how many places this has happened, but it has happened,” he said, adding that many other districts are overseen by either acting or interim U. S. attorneys. In only about 20 of the 94 federal districts, Tobias said, has a U. S. attorney gone through the U. S. Senate confirmation process during Trump’s current administration. It’s difficult to determine from the U. S. Department of Justice website exactly how many interim, acting, first assistants and Senate-confirmed U. S. attorneys are leading federal districts. In addition to Vermont, the only other federal district listed on the website as vacant is the Western District of Pennsylvania. That office, like Vermont’s, is also now headed by a person with the title of first assistant U. S. attorney, according to the website. The main difference between an acting and interim U. S. attorney revolves around how long a person can stay in the post with that title, Tobias said, with the acting title allowing for a longer period of time. According to federal law and rules, an interim U. S. attorney can generally serve for 120 days, while an acting U. S. attorney can generally serve for 210 days. There is no such limit for a person serving as first assistant U. S. attorney. It’s unclear of the exact repercussions if a person stays longer in the post than they are allowed by their title, Tobias said, and whether any cases they oversee could be invalidated. “It has to be raised and litigated,” Tobias said, adding that there have been cases challenging the authority of specific prosecutors around the country in other federal district courts that had reached varying rulings. The person holding the first assistant title, he said, is usually the second in command in a U. S. attorney’s office. However, Tobias said, when there is no Senate-confirmed U. S. attorney or acting or interim U. S. attorney for an office, an argument could be made that the first assistant would then be in charge since technically the top post would be vacant. “I think that’s the kind of fast and loose stuff,” he said. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, could not be reached for comment. During the last Trump administration, Christina Nolan was nominated by the president to serve as the U. S. attorney for Vermont and was confirmed by the U. S. Senate in November 2017. She left the post in 2021 following President Joe Biden’s election.",

Most of us know that success isn't linear, and for Buffalo Bills receiver Keon Coleman, the past month has been a tough one. Having had inconsistent performances and off-field issues, Coleman was disciplined and missed two games as a healthy scratch. But he made his return in the Bills' 26-7 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, and caught a crucial fourth-down touchdown to go with his two catches for nine yards, so it was a decent return to the team for Coleman. However, what were Sean McDermott's thoughts on Keon's performance? \"Yeah, that was a big play for us in the game, and sometimes you learn, it's never a straight line success,\" McDermott said. \"It gets kind of messy at times, but those that see it through, that continue to work and take steps in the right direction and persevere, they have a chance to come out of it. \"I saw some signs of some pretty good football, including some of the shorter routes that he ran on some of those slants. So, step in the right direction, like our team, much work to be done for all of us.\" More: Bills' James Cook has pointed message over Josh Allen hit vs. Steelers Coleman on the comeback trail Just two catches for nine yards isn't anything to celebrate, but Coleman's touchdown, and as McDermott stated, his routes were also positive. Playing 33 snaps against the Steelers (45 percent), that was just three fewer than Khalil Shakir, so it wasn't a case of easing Coleman back into action. The Bills now need Coleman to continue his good showing for the rest of the season. Josh Allen stated post-game that the team is going to need Keon down the stretch, and his touchdown catch was good for the soul, but now he must build on it. Consistency is the name of the game, and right now, that is the one thing that alludes Coleman. More Bills news:.",

            "content": "The handshake line following UCLA's win over Tennessee women's basketball on Sunday appeared to get tense after Lady Volunteers forward Janiah Barker rebuffed her former UCLA head coach Cori Close. Barker was one of six UCLA players to enter the transfer portal after the Bruins reached the Final Four for the first time in program history in the 2025 NCAA Tournament last season. Barker transferred to Tennessee for her senior year after spending one season at UCLA under Close, but Sunday's reunion seemed less than warm. Following UCLA's 99-77 win over Tennessee on Sunday, where Barker dropped a season-high 25 points against her former team, Barker and Close briefly shook hands before Barker pulled away from Close's attempted embrace. Close shrugged her shoulders in response as she continued down the handshake line. After the incident, Barker took to social media to clear the air, writing, \"Respect! We shook hands. I wish nothing but the best for Coach (Cori) and my UCLA fam.\" Close was nothing but complimentary of Barker in her postgame press conference, saying, \"I want to wish Janiah Barker nothing but the best. I think she is a spectacular player, she gave us a lot on the court, off the court. And I just want to make sure that I say I wish her nothing but the best the rest of the way through.\" Close said Barker was presented her UCLA Final Four ring ahead of the game, in addition to a handwritten note. \"I actually wrote her a card today. I just said, one of the things I'm always going to appreciate about you is how hard you always worked on your game,\" Close said. \"And to see her shoot the ball the way she did today, this is the best shooting, three-point shooting night maybe she's had of her career and she works at that.\" Barker said returning to Pauley Pavilion was \"emotional,\" but said her mindset was to \"focus on the game\" and \"not let my emotions go too high or too low. It was definitely an emotional game,\" Barker said. \"My mindset was just truly just focus on the game. I know there's a lot of other things that can play into it, but my thing was just keep the main thing, the main thing. Don't take it too personal. I don't even take it personal at all. It's just basketball.\" Barker shot 9-of-17 from the field and 3-of-7 from the field in Sunday's loss and rounded out her stat line with three rebounds, two steals and four turnovers in 27 minutes. However, \"If I'm being honest, I don't care how many points I scored. I'm upset that we lost. I wish that we would have came out here and won,\" Barker added. Barker spent the first two seasons of her collegiate career at Texas A&M, where she averaged 12. 4 points, 6. 9 rebounds and 1. 2 steals in 49 games (34 starts). She transferred to UCLA for her junior year and averaged 7. 4 points, 6. 0 rebounds and 1. 4 assists in 36 games (three starts) last season. Barker applauded Tennessee coach Kim Caldwell for \"just really letting me be myself. She's letting me do everything that I wanted to do in college and I'm so thankful for that,\" Barker said postgame. \"She also has me in a role of being a leader. I've been to a Final Four before, so I know what it looks like to win and it's put me in a position to lead this team. I feel like I didn't do that well today. It's a lot of things that I'm learning as well in this role, so I'm giving myself grace.\" The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news fast.

            "content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. Florida’s effort to restrict minors from accessing certain social media platforms is back in effect after a federal appeals court lifted an injunction last week, but it remains unclear whether companies are actually following the law. WATCH FORREST SAUNDERS' COVERAGE BELOW: Florida’s social media crackdown is back but enforcement remains unclear The Eleventh Circuit reinstated HB 3, Wednesday, halting a preliminary injunction from a lower court. The 2024 statute prohibits children under 14 from creating social media accounts and requires parental consent for 14- and 15-year-olds. Two of the three judges concluded the law avoids First Amendment violations, calling it a “content-neutral” attempt to regulate addictive platform features. The ruling means Attorney General James Uthmeier can immediately begin enforcement while the lawsuit continues in district court. But in practice, enforcement appears far from uniform. On Monday, we were able to open an Instagram account for a 13-year-old test profile, a step HB 3 is intended to block. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Florida House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell (D-Tampa) said the appeals court ruling is only a temporary step and emphasized that the case still faces a full trial at the lower level. She said she supports tools that help keep kids safe online but warned the state against using HB 3 for political purposes. “I just hope that the Attorney General and the state of Florida won't now use this law as a political weapon, to go after opponents or go after companies that they don't like, or to pressure companies into bending to the state of Florida's political will,” she said. “That's not the intent of the legislation.” Former House Speaker Paul Renner, who pushed HB 3 through the legislature during his second year and is now running for governor, championed the law as a critical safeguard for children. He has repeatedly pointed to mental health concerns among teens. “We have almost a third of high school women who say they contemplated suicide in the last year,” Renner said in September. “So getting young kids, 13, 14, 15, off of these addictive platforms, not off the internet, but things that are designed to capture them and addict them and then monetize them, is unacceptable.” Attorney General Uthmeier has also taken a hard-line approach. In an interview shortly after taking office, he said he intends to pursue platforms that violate the law. “If people are not following the law, I am going to go after them,” said Uthmeier. “Yes, and I believe I have a duty to do so. I also think sometimes you have to make an example to show people that this isn't just words on a paper. It means something, and you know, it's going to have to cost them if they want to flout the law and put our young people in danger.” Tech companies involved in the lawsuit argue the opposite. NetChoice, the trade group representing major platforms, said it was disappointed in the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling and vowed to continue its fight. “Florida’s censorship regime not only violates its citizens’ free speech rights but also makes all users especially minors less safe,” said Paul Taske, Co-Director of the NetChoice Litigation Center.",

            "content": "Supreme Court justices expressed numerous concerns today in a case that could determine whether Internet service providers must terminate the accounts of broadband users accused of The appeals court found that Cox did not profit directly from Kagan said the Twitter case and the Smith & Wesson case involving gun sales to Mexican drug cartels show that there are strict limits on what kinds of behavior are considered aiding and abetting. Kagan described how the cases show there is a real distinction between nonfeasance (doing nothing) and misfeasance, that treating one customer like everyone else is not the same as providing special assistance, and that a party “must seek by your action to make it occur” in order to be guilty of aiding and abetting. “If you look at those three things, you fail on all of them,” Kagan said to attorney Paul Clement, who represents Sony. “Those three things are kind of inconsistent with the intent standard you just laid out.” Clement said that to be held liable, an Internet provider “has to know that specified customers are substantially certain to infringe” and “know that providing the service to that customer will make infringement substantially certain.” Justice Neil Gorsuch indicated that determining secondary liability for Internet providers should be taken up by Congress before the court expands that liability on its own. “Congress still hasn’t defined the contours of what secondary liability should look like. Here we are debating them, so shouldn’t that be a flag of caution for us in expanding it too broadly?” Alito: “I just don’t see how it’s workable at all” Clement tried to keep the focus on residential customers, saying that 95 percent of infringing customers are residential users. But he faced questions about how ISPs should handle much larger customers where one or a few users infringe. Justice Samuel Alito questioned Clement about what ISPs should do with a university where some students infringe. Alito didn’t seem satisfied with Clement’s response that “the ISP is supposed to sort of have a conversation with the university.” Alito said that after an ISP tells a university, “a lot of your 50, 000 students are infringing. the university then has to determine which particular students are engaging in this activity. Let’s assume it can even do that, and so then it knocks out 1, 000 students and then another 1, 000 students are going to pop up doing the same thing. I just don’t see how it’s workable at all.” Clement said that hotels limit speeds to restrict peer-to-peer downloading, and suggested that universities do the same. “I don’t think it would be the end of the world if universities provided service at a speed that was sufficient for most other purposes but didn’t allow the students to take full advantage of BitTorrent,” he said. “I could live in that world. But in all events, this isn’t a case that’s just about universities. We’ve never sued the universities.” Barrett replied, “It seems like you’re asking us to rely on your good corporate citizenship too, that you wouldn’t go after the university or the hospital.” Kagan said that if Sony wins, Cox would have little incentive to cooperate with copyright holders. “It seems to me the best response that Cox could have is just to make sure it never reads any of your notices ever again, because all of your position is based on Cox having knowledge of this,” she said. Clement argued in response that “I think willful blindness would satisfy the common law standard for aiding and abetting.” Purpose vs. intent Some of the discussion focused on the legal concepts of purpose and intent. Cox has argued that knowledge of infringement “cannot transform passive provision of infrastructure into purposeful, culpable conduct.” Sony has said Cox exhibited both “purpose and intent” to facilitate infringement when it continued providing Internet access to specific customers with the expectation that they were likely to infringe. Sotomayor said Cox’s position is “that the only way you can have aiding and abetting in this field is if you have purpose,” while Sony is saying, “we don’t have to prove purpose, we have to prove only intent.” Sotomayor told Clement that “we are being put to two extremes here. The other side says, ‘there’s no liability because we’re just putting out into the stream of commerce a good that can be used for good or bad, and we’re not responsible for the infringer’s decision.'” Sotomayor said the question of purpose vs. intent may be decided differently based on whether Cox’s customer is a residence or a regional ISP that buys Cox’s network capacity and resells it to local customers. Sotomayor said she is reluctant “to say that because one person in that region continues to infringe, that the ISP is materially supporting that infringement because it’s not cutting off the Internet for the 50, 000 or 100, 000 people who are represented by that customer.” But a single-family home contains a small number of people, and an ISP may be “materially contributing” to infringement by providing service to that home, Sotomayor said. “How do we announce a rule that deals with those two extremes?” she asked. Clement argued that the DMCA’s “safe harbor takes care of the regional ISPs. Frankly, I’m not that worried about the regional ISPs because if that were really the problem, we could go after the regional ISPs.” Cox’s case has support from the US government. US Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart told justices today that “in copyright law and more generally, this form of secondary liability is reserved for persons who act for the purpose of facilitating violations of law. Because Cox simply provided the same generic Internet services to infringers and non-infringers alike, there is no basis for inferring such a purpose here.” Terminating all access “extremely overbroad” Sotomayor asked Stewart if he’s worried that a Cox win would remove ISPs’ economic incentive to control copyright infringement. “I would agree that not much economic incentive would be left,” Stewart replied. “I’m simply questioning whether that’s a bad thing.” Stewart gave a hypothetical in which an individual Internet user is sued for infringement in a district court. The district court could award damages and impose an injunction to prevent further infringement, but it probably couldn’t “enjoin the person from ever using the Internet again,” Stewart said. “The approach of terminating all access to the Internet based on infringement, it seems extremely overbroad given the centrality of the Internet to modern life and given the First Amendment,” he said. Oral arguments ended with a reply from Rosenkranz, who said Clement’s suggestion that ISPs simply “have a conversation” with universities is “a terrible answer from the perspective of the company that is trying to figure out what its legal obligations are [and] facing crushing liabilities.” Rosenkranz also suggested that record labels pay for ISPs’ enforcement programs. “The plaintiffs have recourse,” he said. “How about a conversation with the ISPs where they talk about how to work out things together? Maybe they kick in a little money. Now, they won’t get billion-dollar verdicts, but if they believe that the programs that Cox and others have aren’t satisfactory, they can design better programs and help pay for them.”.",

            "content": "Among the major streaming platforms, Apple TV has built a reputation for exclusivity, offering only its original film and television lineup, leaving no room for incorporating titles from external sources. However, it appears the streamer is welcoming some flexibility as it’s making a rare exception for one of its most loved series. Ahead of its highly anticipated Season 2 return, Apple TV has made the Idris Elba-led thriller Hijack available to stream on another platform, though not without a catch. Hijack premiered on Apple TV (formerly Apple TV+) in June 2023 and quickly became a breakout hit for the service. The thriller stars Elba as Sam Nelson, a corporate negotiator whose negotiation skills come in handy when his long-haul flight is seized by terrorists midair. The series debuted to strong viewership, becoming only the second Apple TV original to appear on the Nielsen streaming rankings, with 357 million viewing minutes by the time its Season 1 finale aired. The series has remained one of the platform’s most-watched titles long after its debut season concluded, frequently reappearing on the service’s top-ranking lists in the U. S. and internationally. In a bid to draw even more viewers ahead of Season 2, Apple has taken the unusual step of making Hijack available on Prime Video, though with limitations. Only the first episode of Season 1 has been added, and it is currently accessible only to subscribers in the U. K. While the move may seem out of character for Apple, the strategy is well established across the streaming landscape. AMC titles, for instance, have routinely landed on Netflix to build momentum ahead of new seasons, often boosting viewership and funneling audiences back to the show’s original platform. The approach has proven particularly successful for series such as Dark Winds and several titles within The Walking Dead universe. What To Expect From 'Hijack' Season 2 Idris Elba returns as Sam Nelson, whose commute is once again compromised by terrorists. This time, the crisis unfolds on land, with a train serving as the target. Despite the change in setting, the stakes remain just as high, as passengers once again depend on Sam’s sharp instincts and negotiation skills to survive. Production on Season 2 reportedly wrapped in February, but Apple TV is said to have intentionally held the release to prevent overcrowding its slate with multiple concurrently airing series. The streamer has now secured a strategic launch window, confirming that Hijack Season 2 will premiere on Wednesday, January 14, 2026, exclusively on Apple TV. Check out the Season 2 teaser above. You can now watch the first episode of Hijack Season 1 on Prime Video and catch up on the rest on Apple TV.",

Police said it happened Monday morning at an Ace Cash Express off of West Greens Road near I-45. \"Officers responded to a hold up panic alarm, which is usually an alarm that's used by businesses to advise us that they are being robbed,\" said HPD Sgt. Luis Menendez-Sierra HPD said the alert came in around 8: 30 am. \"Our patrol officer arrived on the location approximately 4 minutes later, observed a male suspect and a female employee inside the business,\" Sgt. Menendez-Sierra said. HPD said the suspect walked out with a gun to the woman's back and used her as a shield. Officials said an officer fired their weapon and hit the suspect multiple times. \"Once the suspect was down, our officers approached,\" Sgt. Menendez-Sierra said. \"He was transported to a nearby hospital with all the injuries from the gunshot wounds.\" ABC13 looked at commercial robbery crime data within a five mile radius of this business. According to HPD crime data, there've been 21 reported commercial robberies in the last month in the area, which is just slightly less compared to the same time last year when there were 25 commercial robberies reported. HPD said the female employee was not injured nor were any officers. \"She was just arriving to open up the business when this suspect took advantage of that,\" Sgt. Menendez-Sierra said. \"She's not armed. You know, she's an innocent bystander in this whole situation.\" HPD has not released the name of the suspect. They said from what they can tell right now, he wasn't able to steal anything during this robbery.",

            "content": "Cory Booker married a female woman over the weekend, closing the book on idle speculation about a man often described as \"the Leonardo DiCaprio of American politics.\" The Democratic senator from New Jersey wed his recently acquired fiancée, Alexis Lewis, at an intimate ceremony in Washington, D. C., over the weekend. The move satisfies a major public relations need for Booker and arrives with exquisite timing as he prepares to launch his 2028 presidential campaign. The happy couple shared exclusive details about their relationship and \"private\" wedding ceremony with the New York Times. Booker, 56, and Lewis, 38, reportedly met in May 2024, several weeks after the senator pre-launched his White House bid with a record-breaking (and utterly pointless) filibuster that went viral on Bluesky. Most Democrats celebrated Booker's stunt even though they denounced the filibuster as a \"Jim Crow relic\" that should be abolished. Booker, who has described himself as \"Spartacus,\" met his future bride through a \"mutual friend known for matchmaking.\" Knowledgeable sources tell the Washington Free Beacon that the mutual friend is Anna Wintour, the fashion maven and Democratic megadonor who orchestrated the brief \"romance\" between Bradley Cooper, the Hollywood beefcake, and Huma Abedin, the longtime personal servant of Hillary Clinton. Wintour also hosted an engagement party for Abedin and Democratic billionaire Alex Soros in 2024. After their first meeting, the couple enjoyed a second date that Booker, a normal adult male, described as \"magical.\" They dined on tapas before attending the Broadway show Suffs, a Clinton-produced musical about the women's suffrage movement. They concluded their romantic evening with a stroll through Newark culminating in a makeout session in front of a cathedral. Sources tell the Free Beacon that Booker had impressed Lewis with his knowledge of theater history by spontaneously reciting every \"Best Musical\" Tony winner dating back to 1959. He's still kicking himself for flubbing The Music Man's upset win over heavily favored West Side Story in 1958. Three months later, the pair were engaged. Booker proposed on a beach in Hawaii as a group of native musicians played \"Dreamlover\" by Mariah Carey, one of Lewis's favorite songs since childhood. \"I can't wait to Cher my life with you,\" he reportedly said as the musicians performed an a cappella version of \"Believe\" by Cher, one of Booker's favorite songs that inspired him to pursue a career in politics. Sources tell the Free Beacon the newly engaged couple celebrated by staying up all night picking out floral arrangements and watching an entire season of The Golden Girls. Booker, who described the island getaway as \"exquisite,\" couldn't wait to share the professional photographs he had taken. Numerous online observers remarked that they had never seen a heterosexual American man appear as deliriously happy in a situation not involving sports. The Times declined to provide any information about the exclusive guest list, but the Free Beacon can confirm the following people were in attendance: Wintour, Cooper, Soros, Abedin, Clinton, Gayle King, Anderson Cooper, Ryan Seacrest, David Muir, David Geffen, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Harry Sisson, Madonna, Lawrence Summers, Oprah Winfrey, Sen. Tim Scott (R., S. C.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), former senator Larry Craig (R., Idaho), former senator Kyrsten Sinema (I., Ariz.",

            "content": "FKA twigs has had a busy year. She released not one but two albums, EUSEXUA in January and its companion album, EUSEXUA Afterglow in October, and has been on a collaboration kick, working with Oklou, PinkPantheress, and more. She'll be keeping that momentum in 2026 by embarking on the Body High tour in North America and Europe, where she'll be playing some huge arena shows. Venues include the Coca-Cola Coliseum in Toronto, the Wintrust Arena in Toronto, the O2 Arena in London, in addition to a major date at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The ambitious tour comes after FKA twigs had to postpone and cancel dates for her 2025 EUSEXUA tour, citing visa and production challenges. She announced on TikTok that the cancellations made her feel \"devastated.\" FKA twigs also later cancelled her much hyped slot at Coachella. The multi-hyphenate artist has since seemingly resolved much of her logistical challenges. She headlined Brookklyn's LadyLand Festival in June and met with fans for a special, intimate party in Bushwick to celebrate the release of EUSEXUA Afterglow. Now, after a string of positive reviews of her new companion album, it seems that FKA twigs is ready to reach new heights in a career that has thus far towed the line between underground and mainstream appeal. Brutalismus 3000, Eartheater, Tokischa and Yves Tumor will all be opening on select dates. See everything we know about Twigs' 2026 Body High tour, ahead, and watch the new music video for her song \"Love Crimes.\".",

            "content": "Just clocking in for your TechRadar Cyber Monday deals update? Good, there's plenty to sift through but I've got an absolute peach of a better-than-Black Friday Technics earbuds deal for you. Today, Amazon's running an even bigger discount on the newest EAH-AZ100 than it did on Black Friday proper, because they just crashed to $219. 99 (was $299) in a never-before-seen discount on Amazon! • Shop Amazon's full Cyber Monday sale These flagship earbuds only arrived in January 2025 and our glowing review of the Technics EAH-AZ100 is likely all the proof you need to know they're some of the best earbuds on the market. Technics' formidable array of audio equipment isn't often involved in Black Friday sales, for the simple reason that they're the absolute business the hands-down best for sound. But the thing is that Cyber Monday is cheeky. Cyber Monday doesn't care about your Black Friday savings. Cyber Monday just wants to go one better. So you get it; they're good. Now, know that they're also $80 off for the first time ever $5 cheaper than even their lowest-seen Black Friday price! So let's get to it with the deals block, shall we? (Not in the US? See today's best deals in your region below) Today's best Technics EAH-AZ100 Cyber Monday deal I need to tell you that it's so rare to see a flagship, class-leading, 2025-issue product in a lowest-seen Cyber Monday discount like this. I'd actually started to think that maybe Cyber Monday wasn't all it was cracked up to be, until now. I strongly encourage you to glance over the review linked to in the first section of this bulletin, then consider a purchase if you've been looking for a set of really good noise-cancelling earbuds. As we noted in that highly favourable review (published earlier in the year): \"There’s no denying the lengths to which the company has gone. From the extremely thorough specification (covering everything from multipoint connectivity and adaptive noise-cancellation to Bluetooth 5. 3 connectivity with LDAC compatibility) to design (smaller, lighter and yet somehow no less premium in look and feel to the model they replace), the Technics EAH-AZ100 are ready to compete.\" Then, there's the carefully ergonomic design (Technics pioneered the 'concha-fit thing, which rather does away with the teardrop shape and looks like it shouldn't work, but really, really does) and in a truly premium touch, you get five different sizes of ear tip. The fact that they're still in the top spot of my best earbuds guide is proof that they're the real deal and with a massive 26% (or $80) off the asking price for the first time ever, I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending you buy them, if your budget extends this far. Sonically (and again, this is all from our in-depth review), the Technics EAH-AZ100 are \"never less than ‘very good indeed’ and are capable of giving the class leaders plenty to worry about.\" For me, they're emphatically top of the class. I wear these earbuds regularly (I have done since their release) and it's the detail levels that make all the difference for me that and the premium fit and feel. When listening to LDAC files, I truly believe you cannot beat these Technics earbuds for spacious presentation, detail and the crisp leading edge of notes. Still not sure whether they're the right buy for you? I'll do a mini 'best of the rest' roundup containing every similar deal I love that's still live, below, but you could also check out my roundup of Sony headphone Cyber Monday deals, or my collection of the best Bose Cyber headphones deals, for starters. Happy shopping and never forget that it's all about the music! More Cyber Monday earbuds deals Shop more of today's best Cyber Monday sales.",

            "content": "Mile Svilar is attending the Gran Galà del Calcio in Milan, the event dedicated to the best in Italian football. Before the ceremony, the Roma goalkeeper spoke to Sky Sport. “A year ago, it was hard to imagine this ranking. We all recovered from a dark moment together. From a footballing perspective, it was a dream year: my hard work paid off. Gasperini’s impact has been very positive.” These were the words with which the number 99 began, speaking about 2025, the year he also had a son, and the arrival of Gasperini. Yesterday, the Giallorossi took to the field in front of their fans, who are dreaming of the Scudetto like never before. Roma lost to Napoli, but Svilar sees the glass half full: “To win games like the one against Napoli, you have to do more, but we’re there. It’s still a long and open championship, we’re close to the others, just one point away. We’re improving game after game, we must continue on this path.” Regarding Neres’ goal last night, he said: “I always try to focus on myself, then as a team, we analyze the collective mistakes. I was convinced he didn’t have any space, but he found it. Now let’s move on.” Gasp’s arrival has brought a new mentality to Trigoria, with training sessions more demanding than ever. The Giallorossi goalkeeper commented: “For me, nothing has changed. The goalkeeping coach is the same, but seeing the faces of the others is impressive: I’ve never seen anything like it; it’s incredibly tough.” Finally, he spoke of Daniele De Rossi, the man who established him as a permanent fixture in the first team. “For me, he was the most important coach, but I can’t talk too much about coaches I’ve had in the past. He gave me the opportunity that many before him hadn’t given me, perhaps due to my own mistakes. He may be a great coach, but first and foremost, he’s a great man.”.",

At the Nov. 12, Board of Trustees meeting, the Board approved both the CEO Search & Selection Process Timeline and the composition of the CEO Search Committee, formally initiating the next phase of the search for the college’s permanent President/CEO.

Key components of the website include: Search and Selection Timeline About the Position and Ideal Candidate How to Apply Board of Trustees Members’ profiles About College of the Canyons Important Documents Facts and Statistics About the Community Contact information and links to search-related resources The site has been reviewed by the search consultants to ensure alignment with industry standards and best practices for executive-level recruitment.

            "content": "Apple's head of artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, will step down from his position, the company announced on Monday. The move is the most visible shakeup in Apple's artificial intelligence group since the company announced Apple Intelligence, its AI software suite, in 2024. Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026. Giannandrea will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft. Before that, he worked at Google's DeepMind, according to his LinkedIn profile. Subramanya will be Apple's vice president of AI, the company said, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple said Giannandrea would remain as an advisor until next spring. In a statement, Cook said that Federighi already played a key role in Apple's AI efforts. Federighi is Apple's top software executive. \"In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar's joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,\" Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams at Apple working on the company's foundation models, research, and AI safety, the company said.",

Yes, they instigated violence by parking their cars. Ironically, anti-ICE protesters like this one, who calls ICE agents masked thugs and calls for legislation to ban masks, wears a mask as she tells us the story of the great parking garage rebellion of 2025. Speaking of a \"master class of community resistance,\" here are hundreds of people being trained by a group called \"Hands Off NYC\" to obstruct ICE operations. The post continues: . they held a “training” in Manhattan where they instructed protesters on how to “resist” aka block federal immigration raids in New York City. This organization, whose primary organizer is Indivisible (the same org that received over $7. 2 million from George Soros) has been holding these trainings every weekend. Complete with whistles they hand out and instructions for “code” that protesters can use to help illegals flee ICE while NYers obstruct federal agents. They allege that “500 New Yorkers” attended their training last weekend and at the end they broke up into groups based on their neighborhood. They create Signal group chats so they can quickly communicate and mobilize and have stated that they are committed to building” rapid response networks borough by borough”. They are set to hold upcoming trainings in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn within the next coming weeks and shared posts celebrated yesterday’s illegal actions on their official Instagram page. Here are some of the other Instagram pages who coordinated to mobilize protesters for yesterday’s mobbing of federal officials: Flood the streets NYC 50501 Movement New York Immigration Coalition Immigration Coalition Here's the GOP minority whip of the New York City Council: New York State Senator Julia Salazar disagrees and says she's grateful for all of the New Yorkers who quickly mobilized to block ICE. \"Get out of our city\"? That's what ICE has been trying to do with all of the illegal aliens living there get them out of the city. If not outright illegal, it's not a good look for an elected official to cheer on insurrectionists breaking the law. And yes, she's the chair of the Crime Victims, Crime, and Correction Committee. *** Editor’s Note: Democrat politicians and their radical supporters will do everything they can to interfere with and threaten ICE agents enforcing our immigration laws.",

At the low price of $25 a roll, fans of the Florida Governor can score “Ron DeSanta” wrapping paper. “This Christmas, wrap your gifts like your politics: bold and conservative. Every roll supports RON PAC’s mission to take the Florida Blueprint nationwide. Order now before we run out,” the landing page urges. Those who don’t want merch adorned with the Governor’s face can opt for “Freedom Is My Favorite Gift” paper at the same price. Other material is available to be wrapped, including a wide selection of Alligator Alcatraz shirts and a “RON PAC Navy 1/4 Zip Fleece Pullover.” The new merchandise may be a way to reverse negative cash flow earlier in 2025.",
