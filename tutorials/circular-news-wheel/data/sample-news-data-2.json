JNN reporters gained access to heavily damaged areas in southern Thailand, where the impact has been severe. As Matcha’s popularity continues to climb, with overseas shipments expanding sharply and exports increasing more than tenfold over the past 15 years as global demand strengthens. Japan is encouraging tea growers to shift production to tencha, the raw material used to make matcha. While it may seem logical that farmers should simply increase production if matcha is selling so well, growers say the reality is far more complex. Princess Aiko, the eldest daughter of the Emperor and Empress, celebrated her 24th birthday on December 1st after a year marked by a series of first-time imperial events, public duties and her inaugural overseas official visit, according to the Imperial Household Agency. A fire broke out on the night of November 29th in Kyoto’s busy Pontocho entertainment district, prompting a large-scale evacuation as flames spread from one restaurant to neighboring buildings. From high above Kyoto, the city’s autumn colors can be seen spreading vividly across the landscape, with trees throughout the area turning a deep, striking red that stands out even from the air.",

Ishin had previously insisted that if no agreement was reached within a year, 50 proportional representation seats alone should be eliminated, but that proposal drew strong opposition from other parties. LDP leader Takai and Ishin leader Yoshimura further confirmed their agreement to cut Lower House seats by about 10 percent as a fallback measure to guarantee the effectiveness of the bill they plan to submit to the current Diet session. Both parties will now move toward drafting legislation centered on reducing 25 single-member district seats and 20 proportional representation seats.",

            "content": "U. S. Rep. Kat Cammack said she’s siding with a constituent in a nasty domestic dispute with a Republican colleague. The Gainesville Republican voted in November against tabling a censure resolution against U. S. Rep. Cory Mills, a New Smyrna Beach Republican. The measure was ultimately sent to the House Ethics Committee, which is already investigating the troubled Congressman. Cammack was among the members ready to take up the matter on the floor. “Staying silent doesn’t make a problem disappear it enables it,” she told Florida Politics in a statement responding to an inquiry about Mills. “Ignoring serious ethics violations doesn’t strengthen our party; it weakens our mission and erodes the trust voters place in us. Real leaders confront hard truths, not hide from them. I’ve never hesitated to call out misconduct, no matter who’s involved. I don’t play favorites, I don’t look the other way, and I wasn’t elected to protect political careers at the expense of the truth.” But in this case, Cammack also noted one of Mills’ scandals involves his alleged mistreatment of a constituent of Florida’s 3rd Congressional District. Lindsey Langston, Columbia County’s Republican State Committeewoman and a recent paramour of Mills, recently obtained a restraining order forbidding the Congressman from contacting her. That followed her reporting threats by Mills to distribute intimate photos and videos after she dumped him and moved out of his home. “Domestic violence and revenge porn are painful realities for countless women in this country,” Cammack said. “My constituent is one of them a victim of revenge porn and dating violence perpetrated by my colleague. I stood with her because that is my responsibility, and because it is the right thing to do.” Cammack co-founded and co-chairs the Republican Women’s Caucus, which was only formed in March of this year. She said Republicans in Congress must stand up for women in the country. “As a woman in Congress and as Florida’s representative, I will not ignore a victim who is also my constituent. Silence would only bury her voice and the voices of so many others harmed by abuse of power.”.",

            "content": "Bettors in Missouri can now download sports betting apps and bet on sportsbooks as the Show-Me State has officially launched legalized sports betting today. But which mobile sportsbooks should you consider signing up with? Nine sportsbooks have secured licenses to operate and each offer Missouri sportsbook promos for new customers. These sportsbook promos vary in size and complexity, and there’s a lot more to deciding which is the best sports betting app than just which one has the best welcome bonus. The Independent’s team of gambling experts have taken an in-depth look at all of the sportsbook apps now available for Missouri sports betting, and we’ve ranked the top eight, weighing up the pros and cons of each sports betting app to give you the clearest picture. Those planning to download a Missouri sports betting app are reminded that gambling should only be enjoyed in a responsible and safe manner. Of the nine sportsbooks awarded temporary licenses by the Missouri Gaming Commission, eight currently have downloadable sports betting apps. Both DraftKings and CircaSports have received untethered licenses, meaning they are independent of any casinos in Missouri. Certain sportsbooks with tethered licenses have also signed partnerships with sports franchises in Missouri. Bet365 are partnered with MLB outfit St. Louis Cardinals, whilst NFL franchise Kansas City Chiefs are partnered with BetMGM. MLS team St. Louis City SC are tied to FanDuel, whilst Fanatics and Caesars Sportsbooks do not currently have any partnerships with Missouri sports franchises. All apps will require users to be aged 21 and above, and be physically located in Missouri, which will be checked by geo-location verification. The best online sportsbooks have unveiled various promos and offers for new customers. Getting the most bang for your buck is one consideration, but it shouldn’t take preference over the long-term benefits of a quality sportsbook app. We have ranked the following Missouri sports betting apps based on their best features, expected bonuses, and what makes them stand out. When reviewing Missouri sports betting apps, we have considered the user experience, reputation, security, usability and value each sportsbook provides. For example, we look at how easy it is to search the different markets in order to place the bet we want to wager. As sports betting has only just gone live in Missouri, we used the out-of-state versions of our recommended sportsbook apps to do our testing prior to the Missouri betting launch. That means we have judged these Missouri sports betting apps on their expected features. Awarded one of two untethered Missouri licenses, DraftKings have launched in the Show Me State with an excellent all-around package, featuring competitive odds across professional and college sports, an excellent rewards program and one of the highest-rated sports betting apps. Originally founded in 2012 to provide fantasy sports services, DraftKings has expanded into one of the top sportsbooks in the country and has the app to match. Users have praised the DraftKings apps for being easy to use, largely reliable and containing all the features you’d find on the desktop version of the sportsbook. Missourians can find out for themselves now by downloading the app and taking up the welcome offer of bet $5, get $300 in bonus bets with the DraftKings Missouri promo. Aside from an easy-to-use app, DraftKings have an established ‘Dynasty Rewards’ program for loyal customers, with various tiers of benefits. Parlay and same game parlay (SGP) promotions are expected to be regular features on DraftKings, who also offer a quick parlay builder that is perfectly suited to its sports betting app. DraftKings Missouri is expected to have one of the deepest markets for a majority of professional sports, with unique markets such as combined player props and alternative line props making the app the best option for Missouri bettors, in our opinion. In other states, FanDuel has forged a reputation for having one of the best mobile app experiences, especially in the eyes of casual bettors, and they are likely to challenge for that crown in Missouri. As an official betting partner for MLS outfit St. Louis City SC, bettors can anticipate promos focused on MLS matches, alongside what tends to be strong coverage of all the professional and college teams in the state. The parlay hub showcases trending bets and other popular SGPs, offering inspiration for wagers of your own. Competitive odds are also reflected on the app’s SGP builder, which is easy to use, even for beginners. You can also keep closer tabs on your bets, with a healthy offering of live streams in the app for multiple events. Another key feature is the quick turnaround for withdrawals, further strengthening the user experience with the FanDuel app. However, the ease of use associated with the FanDuel app does come at a cost, with the entire experience slightly stripped back and lacking at times. There is currently no loyalty rewards program for customers, for example. The offering on sports outside of the US is quite limited, with a lack of choice also reflected in fewer niche betting markets. However, the good definitely outweighs the bad with this behemoth of sports betting apps and bettors who sign up on or after December 1 can get up to $300 in bonus bets with the Fanduel Missouri promo. Bet365 is one of the biggest betting brands on the planet, thanks in part to its reliable, intuitive and feature-packed sports betting app. The Bet365 app in Missouri has one of the most extensive live streaming libraries offered by sportsbooks, allowing bettors to see how their bets play out on screen. Live markets will be another key feature of the Bet365 app for Missouri bettors, with detailed stats, both pre-game and live, allowing customers to make informed bets. Two drawbacks of Bet365 are the absence of a rewards program and lack of promos, although they do make up for the latter issue with an early payout promo on NFL, NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL and soccer, and a 100 per cent parlay payout boost. As expected due to their global status, there is a huge selection of sports markets from all over the world, but they are keen to establish themselves in Missouri, partnering with the St. Louis Cardinals and establishing the Bet365 Bridge at Busch Stadium. If you love the thrill of placing bets as the action happens, Bet365 will be the sports betting app for you in Missouri. One of seven operators with a tethered license, MGM Sports already has a strong presence in Missouri. Agreeing a partnership with the Kansas City Chiefs, the most popular sports franchise in the state, certainly helps, but pre-existing Century Casinos in Missouri makes MGM a recognisable brand. MGM Sports are tapping into that, with its loyalty program providing rewards that can be used in MGM hotels and casinos nationwide. In fact, their rewards program will arguably be the strongest selling point of the app when sports betting starts in Missouri today. On top of the rewards, there is a generous BetMGM Missouri bonus code of up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first stake loses, while app users will find a range of daily odds boosts available on a variety of sports. With deep betting markets across a variety of sports, the MGM Sports app will have broad appeal to Missouri gamblers, although its odds can sometimes be less competitive than those found on rival apps. Other notable features of the MGM Sports betting app include live streaming of games. Their partnership with the Chiefs will likely feature heavily in their boosts and promotions, especially if the Missouri franchise manage to make the playoffs. As the official live streaming partner of the NFL, Caesars is the only Missouri betting app where you can watch and bet on the NFL. Missourians will find the Caesars sports betting app to be heavily skewed towards the NFL and the Kansas City Chiefs during the season with regular odds boosts and promos. If the NFL is the best sports feature of the app, then its biggest practical strength is its cash-out feature, giving customers a lot of control over their wagers. A large selection of payment options is also appreciated, with certain banking methods offering instant payouts on withdrawals. Bettors will also be able to use the app to track their progress in the Caesars Rewards program, which offers a range of benefits, including bonus bets, odds boosts, show tickets, and hotel stays. The app isn’t perfect. It can be slow to load at times, while the live betting options can feel quite limited compared to rival sportsbooks. The Caesars Missouri promo for new customers is also smaller than some other betting apps. The Fanatics sportsbook is mobile-only and given there’s plenty to like about it, Fanatics may end up climbing our rankings of Missouri sports betting apps. The clean, modern user interface allows bettors to easily find odds and place bets, as well as view their FanCash rewards. FanCash is earned on every wager, win or lose, with up to 10 per cent of your original stake added to your account. FanCash can then be converted to bonus funds. FanCash rewards can be used to purchase merchandise of Missouri franchises such as the Kansas City Chiefs and St. Louis Cardinals, or exchanged for bonus bets and other sportsbook promos. There are also free-to-play games which pay out FanCash rewards, offering customers more chances to secure bonus funds or merchandise discounts. Fanatics, who will have retail locations at Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City and Ameristar Casino Resort St. Charles, also have one of the best welcome offers among Missouri sportsbooks with new customers able to claim up to $300 in FanCash in return for a $30 investment. TheScore Bet brings a clean, streamlined sportsbook experience to Missouri, replacing ESPN BET. While its official promo code hasn’t been released yet, bettors can likely expect a simple, generous offer similar to other states, which has typically been ‘Bet $10, Get $100’. The app stands out for its smooth integration of scores, news and betting odds in one easy-to-navigate feed. Everything feels fast and modern. Compared to alternatives, theScore Bet is simpler than DraftKings and faster, more refined, and less cluttered than BetMGM. Same-game parlays and ongoing promotions are limited, but its reliability, clean design, and intuitive layout make it a strong everyday sportsbook. Banking options are wide-ranging, deposits are instant, and navigation is effortless. Overall, theScore Bet is an excellent choice for Missouri bettors. Circa Sports has offered a sportsbook in Las Vegas since 2019, but is still relatively unknown on the nationwide sports betting scene, and it was a surprise when the Missouri Gaming Commission awarded them one of two untethered licenses. So what can Missourians expect? Circa are known for offering the sharpest lines on game and futures markers. Users of the Circa app will anticipate better odds in comparison to competing sportsbooks. However, rival operators will likely offer wider markets on various sports. Live betting will also be offered to Missouri bettors. Whilst there is currently no welcome bonus promised to bettors, Circa Sports are known for its ‘Survivor Contests’ and betting competitions, offering customers different ways to play. However, of all the Missouri betting apps we’ve reviewed, this is the only one that scores below 4 on both iOS and Android, with users complaining of poor functionality and a lack of markets. This is a Missouri betting app for those seeking the sharpest lines and don’t mind a product that’s rough around the edges. Sports betting is legal in Missouri as of today, December 1. All Missouri betting apps will require geo-location checks to confirm you’re physically inside the state, along with ID verification to ensure you are 21 or older. Regulators initially explored an earlier rollout to include March Madness 2025, but emergency rules were rejected, pushing the universal launch to December 1 for both online and retail sportsbooks. Of course, one size does not fit all, so bettors should think about what they prioritize when looking for a suitable app. Betting should be a fun experience, so customers will be turned away if it’s a chore to place bets on an app. As such, intuitive design is an important factor. Users should be able to quickly navigate to the markets they wish to place bets on. Bettors should check reviews to see if other users have had issues with crashes, freezes, or slow loading times. The best sports betting apps offer diverse bet types with competitive odds across multiple markets. While some apps like Underdog specialize in props, most bettors want variety and value. Compare odds between sportsbooks and look for reduced juice and lower commission to maximize long-term profitability. Quick deposits, flexible minimums, reasonable payout limits, and multiple payment options matter. Slow processing means missed bets, while limited banking methods create unnecessary hassles for both casual and serious bettors. Welcome bonuses grab attention, but don't let flashy sign-up offers distract you from other considerations. Different promos suit different betting styles, and a sportsbook with a smaller welcome bonus might offer better long-term value through rewards programs and ongoing promotions. Check what's available for loyal customers, not just new ones, and prioritize offers with clear terms and reasonable wagering requirements. Live streaming elevates the betting experience by letting you bet and watch. Availability varies by sportsbook with some offering extensive lists, while others have limited streaming options or none at all. Live streaming pairs perfectly with live betting, allowing you to place wagers as the action unfolds. Combined with cash-out options and real-time odds updates, the best apps offer a comprehensive live betting experience. Quality customer support matters when issues arise. Look for Missouri betting apps offering 24/7 customer support, multiple contact methods (live chat, email, phone), and fast response times. The best operators also provide comprehensive FAQ sections that solve common problems without needing to contact support. There are many aspects to consider when choosing the best Missouri sports betting app, as outlined below. First, consider whether you are a novice or an experienced bettor. Beginners may appreciate FanDuel’s clean interface, while casual sports fans might enjoy Fanatics’ FanCash rewards that can be redeemed for merchandise from their favourite Missouri sports team. For fans of live betting, Bet365’s live service is hard to beat, while the sharpest customers might be swayed by Circa’s market-beating odds. The Kansas City Chiefs are the biggest franchise in Missouri having dominated the NFL for the best part of seven years. It is no surprise that their popularity will be reflected by sportsbooks when online sports betting starts in Missouri on December 1. Caesars has strong links to the NFL, whilst BetMGM Sports is the official sports betting partner of the Kansas City Chiefs. The MLB is represented by two teams in Missouri, with the St. Louis Cardinals partnered with Bet365 and the Kansas City Royals linked to Underdog. Expect both platforms to offer multiple tie-ins and promotions over the course of the baseball season. Underdog is also the partner for NHL franchise St. Louis Blues. Depositing and withdrawing funds from your sportsbook account will be a common occurrence, so when choosing which app you will use, keep in mind banking options and payment speeds. Bet365 provide some of the fastest payouts at under 24 hours. Caesars and BetMGM currently offer the most payment options for both deposits and withdrawals. DraftKings, Fanatics, FanDuel, and BetMGM all offer Play+ card integration, which could be a deciding factor for Play+ card users. Missouri bettors will find no shortage of welcome bonuses, but the best value isn’t always in the biggest upfront offer. While sign-up promos can be appealing, long-term features such as loyalty programs, reward points and cashback schemes often deliver greater ongoing benefit. Fanatics’ FanCash, for example, can be used for bonus bets or real merchandise, while operators like BetMGM and Caesars tie their sportsbook rewards into broader casino and entertainment perks. If you expect to bet regularly, choosing a sportsbook that consistently rewards your play may be far more valuable than selecting an app based solely on a large one-time bonus. Sports betting is now legal in Missouri, with bettors able to place wagers from Monday, December 1. To legally bet on sports in Missouri you must be over the age of 21 and be physically in Missouri. It is important to have a valid government-issued ID to hand when registering, such as a driver’s license or passport, as well as your chosen payment method. Once you have decided which app best aligns with your betting preferences, head to the appropriate app store for your device. In order to verify your age, sports betting apps will request government-issued ID, such as a passport or driver’s license. You will have to take clear photos of both the front and back of the ID with your phone. Verification is typically approved within minutes, but it can take up to a few hours. Additional verification of your address may also be required, usually in the form of a utility bill or bank statement. Once you have created your account and sports betting has become legal in Missouri, you will be able to place wagers. Before placing a bet, you must ensure that you have enough funds in your account. Navigate to the banking or cashier section, and then select your preferred deposit method. Enter the amount of the deposit, bearing in mind any minimum requirements for bonuses. If required, you may need to apply a promo code as part of the welcome offer. Now, you can confirm your deposit. Depending on the terms of your welcome offer, you may already be eligible to receive the bonus funds. However, your bonus funds might be tied to placing a qualifying bet. Bonus funds are typically credited automatically after a qualifying bet has been settled. Gambling should be a fun activity. If you find yourself struggling to stay in control of your gambling, there are multiple responsible gambling tools available sports betting apps. You can set deposit limits, either on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, as well as limiting the amount of time you spend on the app with time limits or reality checks. Session reminders can also be set, while it is important to familiarize yourself with self-exclusion options, just in case. You should regularly review your account activity to remain fully aware of how much and how often you are betting. To use any sports betting app in Missouri, you must be 21 years or older. This is verified through ID checks during registration, ensuring strict compliance with state laws. Underage betting is illegal, and sportsbooks are required to block anyone who cannot meet age-verification standards. Bettors must be physically located within Missouri to place wagers. Sportsbook apps confirm this using GPS, WiFi, and other geolocation tools. If you’re near a state border, the system may occasionally struggle to confirm your position. You cannot place bets from neighbouring states, even if sports betting is legal there. Importantly, you do not need to be a Missouri resident, you just need to be inside Missouri at the time of betting. Winnings of $5, 000 or more are subject to 24% federal withholding tax. Sportsbooks do not tax withdrawals, but all gambling winnings count as taxable income. Once Missouri launches sports betting, residents must report gambling winnings on their state tax returns. Keeping detailed records of your betting activity is strongly recommended. Sports betting should always be viewed as entertainment, not a source of income. Set clear limits, stay in control, and stop when the fun stops. Never wager more than you can comfortably afford to lose, and take regular breaks to maintain a healthy balance. All licensed U. S. sportsbooks and Missouri betting apps provide built-in responsible gambling tools designed to help you stay in control. These include deposit limits, time-outs, reality checks, and full self-exclusion options, all easily accessible within your account settings. With so many Missouri sportsbook app offers arriving for the launch, it’s important not to get swept up in the excitement. Take advantage of promotions wisely, stick to your budget, and prioritize safe, responsible play above everything else. If you ever feel your gambling is becoming difficult to manage, contact the National Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-GAMBLER or visit ncpgambling. org for free, confidential support. In addition, the Missouri Dept. of Mental Health and the state’s Gaming Commission can also provide assistance if gambling becomes a problem: Beginners should consider FanDuel for the overall user experience, or Fanatics for simple and consistent rewards. Experienced bettors will be impressed by DraftKings’ features, although live betting fans will prefer Bet365. Those enticed by rewards should opt for BetMGM or Caesars, with both offering entertainment and hotel perks. Missourians who love the Kansas City Chiefs will be catered for by DraftKings, official betting partner BetMGM, and FanDuel, whilst St. Louis Cardinals fans will be covered by official sponsors Bet365, Underdog, and Caesars. When will Missouri sports betting apps be available? Bettors can now download apps, create accounts, deposit funds and bet, with wagering legally permitted since December 1, 2025. What sports betting apps are legal in Missouri?

            "content": "Belgian authorities are investigating the theft of an infant Jesus figure from a Christmas Nativity scene in Brussels, an icon that had previously drawn widespread online scorn for its unusual design. The figure was snatched from its crib in the Grand Place between late Friday night and early Saturday morning. This particular depiction of the infant Jesus, part of a larger Nativity display, became the subject of a social media maelstrom due to its characters lacking distinct facial features such as eyes, noses and mouths. Artist Victoria-Maria Geyer created the cloth figures with the intention that “every Catholic, regardless of their background or origins can identify themselves” in the biblical narrative, hoping the featureless forms would resonate with observers globally. However, the design was not universally appreciated. Georges-Louis Bouchez, leader of Belgium's center-right MR party, publicly criticized the artwork on X, stating that Geyer's cloth Christ “in no way represent the spirit of Christmas.” He went further, likening the figures to “zombie-like” individuals often seen at train stations. The theft of the controversial figure now adds another layer of intrigue to the already much-discussed Nativity scene. Last year more than 4 million people visited the Christmas market in the center of Brussels’ historic old city to sip mulled wine and hot chocolate and shop at 238 vendors of toys, clothes and ornaments. The center of the square is an enormous Christmas tree looming over a simple white tent holding the manger scene with the figures made by Geyer, a self-professed devout Catholic. Her work was selected by both the local Catholic Church and the City of Brussels in an annual tradition, said Delphine Romanus, deputy director of Brussels Major Events, which manages the manger and market. Early reports that the infant Jesus had been beheaded are false, but Romanus said that in the past other baby Jesus figurines have been broken or stolen. An initial deluge of negative comments on social media has turned positive, Geyer said. Authorities have already replaced the baby Jesus in the crib. Organizers and security say they will keep a closer eye on the manger, but they have not taken any additional precautions. Staring at the new baby Jesus, Brussels resident Francis De Laveleye shook his head and said that arguments of artistic merit should never descend into such a sordid affair. “What is intolerable is that people attack the work of an artist to damage it and to turn it into a kind of stupid little controversy that ridicules Brussels.”.",

            "content": "For decades, he walked into the ring with a smile, staring down the most lethal punchers in boxing history without blinking. The eight-division world champion has faced everyone from Floyd Mayweather to Oscar De La Hoya. Yet, the sight of his own son trading blows turned the legendary 'PacMan' into a bundle of nerves. Nothing in his career could prepare him for the helplessness of watching from ringside as his son's professional debut nearly went off the rails. Following a shocking performance that saw his son escape with a draw, the Filipino icon has issued a firm ultimatum. If the family legacy is to continue inside the ropes, it will only be under his strict supervision. A Turbulent Professional Debut The tension in Temecula, California, was palpable as 24-year-old Manny Pacquiao Jr., known affectionately as Jimuel, stepped into the professional ranks. His opponent was not a hand-picked journeyman but Brendan Lally, an English teacher and former collegiate champion from the University of Illinois. What was expected to be a showcase at the Pechanga Resort Casino quickly became a dogfight. While the elder Pacquiao's own professional debut 30 years ago ended in a points victory, his son's introduction to the prize ring was far more turbulent. After four hard-fought rounds, the judges returned a split decision that left the crowd murmuring. One judge scored the bout 39-37 for Pacquiao, but two others saw it even at 38-38, resulting in a majority draw. Speaking to reporters backstage, the elder Pacquiao did not hide his distress. While expressing pride in Jimuel's heart, he made it clear that the current training arrangement was insufficient. 'It's the plan,' Pacquiao said when asked if his son would box again. 'I want to make sure that, if he fights again, I'm gonna supervise his training.' This isn't just a suggestion from a concerned father; it appears to be a non-negotiable condition for Jimuel's future in the sport. The boxing legend was adamant that he could not sit through another performance like that without being directly involved in the preparation. 'He can fight again, but I have to make sure I'm supervising his training. I don't want that to happen again.' A Crucial Flaw Spotted Ringside The fight itself was a tale of two halves, exposing the harsh learning curve of professional boxing. Jimuel appeared to control the opening two rounds, but as the fight wore on, Lally surged back, edging the final two rounds. For the elder Pacquiao, the technical deficiencies were glaring. He pinpointed exactly what went wrong and what needs to change before Jimuel signs another contract. 'He needs to improve his instincts and focus on his opponent in the fight,' Manny observed. Jimuel, for his part, seemed to understand the gravity of the moment. In an interview with former world champion Shawn Porter, the young prospect admitted that the fight descended into a brawl rather than a tactical contest. 'In my head, I was just like, bite down and stay in there with him and, you know, just try to outslug him,' Jimuel confessed. Despite the disappointment of not securing a win, the former amateur, with a 6-4 record, remained optimistic about the lessons learned. 'It's good, because for the next pro fights, if this happens again, then I've experienced it already and I know what to expect.' What Is Next For Manny Pacquiao? While he manages his son's budding career, the 46-year-old icon has his own ambitions to chase. Manny Pacquiao is still eyeing history, hoping to break his own record by becoming the oldest welterweight titleholder of all time. He came agonisingly close to that goal in July when he fought Mario Barrios. That bout, much like his son's debut, ended in a controversial majority draw, leaving Pacquiao empty-handed but hungry for redemption. If a title shot at 147lbs (66. 7kg) remains elusive, the boxing world could be treated to one final mega-event. Talks for a rematch with his old rival Floyd Mayweather are believed to be ongoing. However, with the calendar approaching 2026, everything remains 'up in the air'. Whether he is cornering his son or lacing up the gloves himself, one thing is certain: the Pacquiao fighting saga is far from over.",

            "content": "The House unanimously passed a bill on Monday barring anyone linked to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel from moving to the United States. It's a rare moment of bipartisanship on the topic of Israel, an issue that's otherwise exacerbated deep fractures within both parties in the House of Representatives particularly for Democrats. The Republican-led legislation is called the \"No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act of 2025\" and was introduced by Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. CHIP ROY AND OTHER REPUBLICANS PUSH BILL TO BLOCK AND DEPORT SHARIA LAW-ADHERENT ALIENS: 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' It passed the House by voice vote on Monday afternoon, meaning it advanced with unanimous approval without lawmakers taking individual votes on the bill. \"There are still some things we can come together on in this body, and one of them is opposition to Hamas and the terrorism they unleashed on civilians in Israel more than two years ago,\" McClintock told Fox News Digital. \"What this does is place them in the same category as Nazi collaborators in the Holocaust, which are also referenced in the Immigration Nationality Act.\" NEARLY 200 HOUSE DEMS VOTE AGAINST HIKING CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FELONS The bill now heads to the U. S. Senate, where a parallel effort was introduced earlier this year by Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev. McClintock told Fox News Digital he was hopeful the Senate would take up the bill while noting it passed the House last term as well without the upper chamber taking action. \"The repeated actions of the House in passing this bill, I think, will hopefully inspire the Senate to take it up this year and send it to the president,\" he said. \"It's important for two reasons. Number one, to prevent a future Joe Biden from admitting such people, and to empower a future Donald Trump presidency to keep them out.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE.",

The agreement was signed by the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office along with multiple county agencies, including the Social Services, Behavioral Health Services, and Public Health divisions of the Calaveras Health and Human Services Agency. The Calaveras County Probation Department, District Attorney’s Office, Office of Education, and The Resource Connection of Calaveras and Amador Counties, operating through the Calaveras Crisis Center and Children’s Advocacy Center, also joined the effort. The MOU reaffirms the agencies’ commitment to a coordinated approach to investigating and prosecuting cases while ensuring comprehensive case management for victims. Officials said the document formalizes ongoing oversight and cooperation between departments and partner organizations to better identify and assist victims, as well as children at risk. Authorities noted that the public can play a role by reporting suspected trafficking to law enforcement, recognizing that exploitation is driven by demand, and discussing trafficking issues within their communities. The National Human Trafficking Hotline can be reached at 1-888-373-7888.",

Taiwan has moved to reassure diplomatic stability with St Vincent and the Grenadines, expressing confidence in maintaining their long-standing relationship despite recent political leadership changes, government officials stated on Tuesday. The reassurance comes after the opposition New Democratic Party (NDP) won last week’s election, with Godwin Friday succeeding Ralph Gonsalves as prime minister. While the NDP has historically advocated for potential diplomatic recognition shift towards Beijing, Taiwan’s foreign ministry remains optimistic about preserving bilateral ties. Taiwan’s deputy foreign minister Chen Ming-chi emphasized the 44-year relationship’s depth, highlighting collaborative achievements in agriculture, healthcare, and information technology. “We will remain vigilant but confident in our continued relationship,” Chen told reporters, stressing the commitment to maintaining diplomatic connections. The ministry quickly engaged diplomatically, with Taiwan’s ambassador in Kingstown extending congratulations immediately after the election results. Newly elected Prime Minister Friday reportedly expressed appreciation and requested thanks be conveyed back to Taipei. Legislative perspectives within Taiwan remain nuanced. While some lawmakers like Wang Ting-yu acknowledge potential diplomatic uncertainties, others like Chung Chia-pin advocate respecting St Vincent’s democratic processes. “Ties remain close and friendly for now,” Wang noted, while simultaneously warning about potential strategic maneuvers by Beijing. Chung emphasized continuing cooperation based on “mutual trust, mutual benefit, and democratic principles.”.",

            "content": "Widely blamed for the problems Apple had adding AI to Siri, AI executive John Giannandrea is leaving the company. AI researcher Amar Subramanya has joined Apple as vice president of AI and will report to Craig Federighi. He previously worked on AI at Google and Microsoft. “We are thankful for the role John played in building and advancing our AI work, helping Apple continue to innovate and enrich the lives of our users,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said. “AI has long been central to Apple’s strategy, and we are pleased to welcome Amar to Craig’s leadership team and to bring his extraordinary AI expertise to Apple. In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year.” Apple hired Giannandrea away from Google in 2018, and it seemed like quite the coup at the time. He took over Apple’s AI efforts, was quickly elevated to Apple’s executive team, and he reported directly to CEO Tim Cook. But several years later, there’s little forward progress to show. Siri is particularly embarrassing, especially given that Apple was the first Big Tech company to bring a digital assistant to market. Apple had taken control of Siri away from Giannandrea in March after his team failed to adapt the technology for Apple Intelligence as promised at WWDC 2024. Since then, he’s led the work to develop Apple’s foundational AI models, while Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell has taken over Siri. In his new role as vice president of AI, Subramanya will take over the foundational AI model work, and the rest of Giannandrea is being moved elsewhere within Apple. “With Giannandrea’s contributions as a foundation, Federighi’s expanded oversight, and Subramanya’s deep expertise guiding the next generation of AI technologies, Apple is poised to accelerate its work in delivering intelligent, trusted, and profoundly personal experiences,” Apple claims. “This moment marks an exciting new chapter as Apple strengthens its commitment to shaping the future of AI for users everywhere.”.",

National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) chief executive Philip Reed wrote to the Senate on November 25 to clarify earlier evidence he had provided related to NACC commissioner Paul Brereton’s activities as an adviser to the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force (IGADF), the independent defence watchdog. During the earlier evidence, Reed had told the Senate that Brereton’s provision of advice to the IGADF “doesn’t occur during the hours that he works for the commission”.",

            "content": "Outlets that reach millions of news consumers are being denied access to rare briefings by Pentagon officials this week sessions that are being held instead for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s hand-picked media organizations. It’s not as if there’s little to talk about, with both the Senate and House Armed Services committees opening investigations into U. S. military strikes against alleged drug couriers in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. Hegseth’s team says the briefings are part of special orientation events for a newly credentialed Pentagon press corps, consisting primarily of conservative outlets that agreed to his new rules for operation. Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson is due to meet reporters Tuesday and Hegseth will do so Wednesday. Most mainstream outlets exited the Pentagon this fall rather than agree to the new rules. The Defense Department says they are “common sense” regulations designed to prevent the spread of classified information. news outlets worried they would effectively be agreeing only to report news approved by Hegseth. Departed journalists still working, just a bit farther away The rules haven’t kept journalists from working, even without the physical access. The Washington Post reported Friday that Hegseth ordered a second strike in September on a boat with suspected drug smugglers after not everyone had been initially killed. President Donald Trump said Hegseth had denied he did this, which some critics have said was a potential war crime if true. The Post, The Associated Press, CNN, Reutersmax were some of the outlets that said Monday they had requested special access to the Pentagon to cover question-and-answer sessions, but were denied. “Denying access to briefings to credible and nonpartisan news media that routinely cover the Pentagon is not conducive to transparency for the American public, who fund the department’s budget to the tune of many hundreds of billions of dollars per year,” said Marc Lavine, North America regional director for Agence France-Presse, which also said its request was denied. The department’s press office said Wilson’s briefing is part of a special orientation event “for credentialed press only.” It would not say whether future briefings would follow the same rules. Defense Department briefings used to be routine and regular; only a handful have been held since Trump began his second term. It’s unclear whether any of the briefings will be seen outside the Pentagon. Lavine said AFP was told access to livestreams was not possible. Newcomers take to social media Some of the new Pentagon press corps posted pictures of themselves online Monday wearing their credentials. They included influential Trump ally Laura Loomer, pictured sitting at an empty desk. “The Washington Post @washingtonpost and Dan Lamothe @DanLamothe used to occupy this desk inside the Pentagon Press room,” she wrote. “Now it’s mine!” Replied Lamothe on X: “May it treat you well on your occasional trips to Washington, Laura. I assume it’ll sit empty much of the time, as it has for weeks now.” Alexandra Ingersoll and former U. S. Rep. Matt Gaetz were recently credentialed at the Pentagon on behalf of One America News. Ingersoll is expected to report live this week from the Pentagon, said Charles Herring, OAN president. She conducted an interview with Hegseth that appeared on the network Nov. 20. Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of The Daily Signal, said he expected to attend the briefings with reporter Bradley Devin, assuming some last-minute snags with their credentials are smoothed out. Bluey, in an interview, said he understood the need for rules in issuing credentials, since his outlet was often denied access to places prior to the Trump administration. “Generally,” he said, “I think that when government agencies err on the side of transparency it is to the benefit of the American people.” ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

            "content": "A senior Republican congressman has pushed back against plans by Donald Trump to dock the pay of air traffic control workers who did not show up for work during the government shutdown. During the historic shutdown, which ultimately lasted for 43 days, from October 1 to November 12, ATCs were expected to work without pay. Some were forced to take extra jobs and many reported being unable to afford essential costs like childcare or fuel to get to their shifts. A number began calling out of work sick, leading to major disruption at airports and prompting Trump to say their pay should be docked. However, the Republican chairman of the U. S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure pushed back on the idea. Rep. Sam Graves told KFEQ: “The problem with something like that is you really don’t know the circumstances,” Sam Graves, who chairs the U. S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. They may have actually been sick.” Graves noted the high-stress nature of air traffic control jobs was coupled with the anxiety of not being paid during the shutdown. “You also can’t fault somebody who’s trying to make a car payment and a mortgage payment,” he said. “You don’t know what their personal circumstance is, and they have to go out and get another job for the time being to try to make ends meet.” The widespread absences led to considerable disruption, causing delays across the country and prompting the government to cut flights at 40 of the busiest airports. Trump initially vowed to cut the pay of those who skipped work, while giving bonuses of up to $10,000 for those who remained on the job. “For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,” he seethed on Truth Social. “You didn’t step up to help the U. S. A. against the FAKE DEMOCRAT ATTACK that was only meant to hurt our Country. You will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record. In addition, out of more than 10, 000 workers who worked during the shutdown, just 776 are set to receive the hefty bonuses after the FAA announced that only controllers with perfect attendance records would qualify for the payments. Since the shutdown ended, Missouri congressman Graves has also brought a bipartisan Bill that would allow air traffic controllers to get paid during future shutdowns. The bill proposes funding salaries, operating expenses and other FAA programs by tapping into a little-used flight insurance fund that was created after the September 11 attacks and currently has $2. 6 billion dollars sitting in it. “We all saw that the system can be vulnerable when Congress can’t get its job done,” Graves said in a statement.”.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON The Department of Transportation is threatening to shut down thousands of truck driving schools as part of the Trump administration's widening crackdown on the U. S. trucking industry. The DOT announced Monday it plans to revoke the accreditation of nearly 3, 000 trucking schools unless they can comply with federal requirements within 30 days, and warned another 4, 000 schools could face similar action. \"We are reigning in illegal and reckless practices that let poorly trained drivers get behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses,\" said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement. The names of the targeted schools were not immediately released. Together they represent more than 40% of the nation's 16, 000 authorized training providers, according to the DOT. The department accuses them of falsifying or manipulating training data, neglecting to meet required curriculum standards and instructor qualifications, and failing to maintain or share accurate records. The crackdown on trucking schools is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to make sure that drivers are qualified and eligible to hold a commercial driver's license or CDL. The DOT has also proposed significant new restrictions on which immigrants can get a CDL, but a federal appeals court put those rules on hold last month. That push for tougher regulations coincided with a series of deadly crashes involving foreign-born truckers including a fatal crash in Florida in August that killed three people. Secretary Duffy argues the restrictions are urgently needed because there are too many foreign-born truckers who don't know the rules of the road, and don't speak English proficiently. But the administration's critics argue there's no data to support this claim, despite a handful of high-profile crashes that have garnered significant attention from conservative media. They say the push for tougher regulations amounts to an immigration crackdown by another name. All of that leaves immigrant truckers in a difficult spot particularly those who've been in the business for a while. \"The safety crackdown has been long overdue,\" said Pawan Singh, who owns a small trucking company in Northern Virginia. In an NPR interview last month, Singh conceded that many schools are churning out drivers without giving them the skills to operate an 18-wheeler safely though he says the problem isn't limited to newly-trained immigrant drivers. \"An untrained driver is dangerous whether they were born here or they were born overseas.\".",

            "content": "DETROIT (AP) Two conservative political operatives were sentenced to probation Monday for a scheme to discourage Black Detroit voters from voting by mail in the 2020 presidential election, the last court hearing in a multistate effort to blast thousands of robocalls. Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman were accused of creating robocalls that warned people they could be hounded by police, debt collectors and government vaccine bureaucrats if they voted by mail. Authorities said the bogus messages targeted urban areas that typically vote Democratic. “Don’t be finessed into giving your private information to the man,” a recorded voice said. In August, Wohl and Burkman pleaded no contest to voter intimidation, conspiracy and computer crimes after a long, unsuccessful effort to challenge the charges on free speech grounds. A Wayne County judge sentenced them to a year of probation. Wohl and Burkman “used every racist dog whistle” to discourage people from voting by mail, said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat. Wohl and Burkman were also pursued for robocalls in New York and Ohio. An Ohio judge in 2022 ordered them to perform 500 hours of community service related to voter registration in Washington, records show. In New York, they settled a lawsuit last year by agreeing to pay up to $1. 25 million, the attorney general’s office said. Defense attorneys in the Michigan case said Wohl and Burkman were ready to move on. “I don’t think he’s going to be back in any court in the future,” said Burkman’s lawyer, Scott Grabel, who acknowledged the robocalls were offensive. Attorney William Amadeo said he’s glad Wohl “can put it behind him.”.",

During Monday’s press briefing, Leavitt announced the results of the president’s MRI test from October, saying the test confirmed he is in excellent overall health. “Everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns,” Leavitt, reading a summary provided to her from the physician to the president, stated. “In summary, this level of detailed assessment is standard for an executive physical at President Trump’s age and confirms that he remains in excellent overall health.” The MR found the president’s cardiovascular and abdominal imaging to be perfectly normal with all major organs and arteries functioning as they should be. The press secretary also said the advanced imagining tests are perfectly normal for men in the president’s age group. President Trump is currently 79-years-old. This comes after the president told reporters in Air Force One over the weekend that he would release the results of his test, calling them “perfect.” Stay informed!

It’s not as if there’s little to talk about, with both the Senate and House Armed Services committees opening investigations into U.

Hegseth’s team says the briefings are part of special orientation events for a newly credentialed Pentagon press corps, consisting primarily of conservative outlets that agreed to his new rules for operation. Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson is due to meet reporters Tuesday and Hegseth will do so Wednesday. Most mainstream outlets exited the Pentagon this fall rather than agree to the new rules. The Defense Department says they are “common sense” regulations designed to prevent the spread of classified information. news outlets worried they would effectively be agreeing only to report news approved by Hegseth. Departed journalists still working, just a bit farther away The rules haven’t kept journalists from working, even without the physical access. The Washington Post reported Friday that Hegseth ordered a second strike in September on a boat with suspected drug smugglers after not everyone had been initially killed. President Donald Trump said potential war crime if true. The Post, The Associated Press, CNN, Reutersmax were some of the outlets that said Monday they had requested special access to the Pentagon to cover question-and-answer sessions, but were denied. “Denying access to briefings to credible and nonpartisan news media that routinely cover the Pentagon is not conducive to transparency for the American public, who fund the department’s budget to the tune of many hundreds of billions of dollars per year,” said Marc Lavine, North America regional director for Agence France-Presse, which also said its request was denied. The department’s press office said Wilson’s briefing is part of a special orientation event “for credentialed press only.” It would not say whether future briefings would follow the same rules. Defense Department briefings used to be routine and regular; only a handful have been held since Trump began his second term. It’s unclear whether any of the briefings will be seen outside the Pentagon. Lavine said AFP was told access to livestreams was not possible. Newcomers take to social media Some of the new Pentagon press corps posted pictures of themselves online Monday wearing their credentials. They included influential Trump ally Laura Loomer, pictured sitting at an empty desk. “The Washington Post @washingtonpost and Dan Lamothe @DanLamothe used to occupy this desk inside the Pentagon Press room,” she wrote. “Now it’s mine!” Replied Lamothe on X: “May it treat you well on your occasional trips to Washington, Laura. I assume it’ll sit empty much of the time, as it has for weeks now.” Alexandra Ingersoll and former U. S. Rep. Matt Gaetz were recently credentialed at the Pentagon on behalf of One America News. Ingersoll is expected to report live this week from the Pentagon, said Charles Herring, OAN president. She conducted an interview with Hegseth that appeared on the network Nov. 20. Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of The Daily Signal, said he expected to attend the briefings with reporter Bradley Devin, assuming some last-minute snags with their credentials are smoothed out. Bluey, in an interview, said he understood the need for rules in issuing credentials, since his outlet was often denied access to places prior to the Trump administration. “Generally,” he said, “I think that when government agencies err on the side of transparency it is to the benefit of the American people.” ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

            "content": "Nigeria’s economy expanded by 3. 98 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, slightly up from 3. 86 per cent in the same period of 2024, according to the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday. The report showed mixed recovery across key sectors, with agriculture and industry posting stronger real growth, while services maintained the largest share of overall output. Aggregate GDP in real terms stood at ₦57. 03 trillion, up from ₦54. 85 trillion in Q3 2024. In nominal terms, output rose 18. 12 per cent year-on-year to ₦113. 59 trillion, compared with ₦96. 16 trillion a year earlier. The services sector contributed 53. 02 per cent of real GDP, followed by agriculture at 31. 21 per cent. Key drivers included crop production, telecommunications, real estate, trade, and financial services. The oil sector posted a real growth of 5. 84 per cent, slightly up from 5. 66 per cent in Q3 2024. Average crude oil production rose to 1. 64 million barrels per day from 1. 47 million barrels per day a year earlier, though slightly below the 1. 68 million barrels per day recorded in Q2 2025. Despite a quarterly contraction of 5. 53 per cent, oil’s contribution to real GDP increased marginally to 3. 44 per cent. Meanwhile, the non-oil sector expanded by 3. 91 per cent, outperforming Q3 2024 (3. 79 per cent) and Q2 2025 (3. 64 per cent). Agriculture grew by 3. 79 per cent, driven mainly by crop production, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the sector’s nominal output. Other sectoral highlights include: Manufacturing: Real growth slowed to 1. 25%, down from 1. 74% in Q2 2025. Contribution to GDP fell to 7. 62%. Construction: Real growth of 5. 57%, slightly below 6. 80% in 2024; contribution at 3. 80%. Trade: 1. 98% real growth, accounting for 16. 42% of GDP. ICT (Information and Communication): 5. 78% real growth; contribution rose to 9. 10%. Real Estate: Nominal output surged 89. 34%, with real growth at 3. 50%. Financial and Insurance Services: Real growth of 19. 63%, though contribution to GDP fell to 2. 65%; nominal growth 40. 55%. Education and Health: Grew modestly at 2. 51% and 2. 89%, respectively. The NBS noted that while most sectors sustained positive momentum, growth remains uneven. Strong gains in ICT, finance, agriculture, and trade helped stabilize overall output. Prince Adeyemi Adeniran, Statistician-General of the Federation, emphasized that the quarterly estimates are benchmarked to the rebased national accounts for consistency, reflecting improvements in data quality and sectoral coverage. Earlier in October 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised Nigeria’s 2025 growth outlook upward to 3. 9 per cent, citing higher oil production, stronger investor confidence, and a supportive fiscal stance as key drivers. The IMF also upgraded the 2026 projection to 4. 2 per cent and revised 2024 growth to 4. 1 per cent. Air Peace said it has initiated a court proceeding against Smartlynx airlines over $38 million loss incurred from the alleged fraudulent act of the company. A statement by the airline said the court issued an order against Smartlynx on November 12, 2025. While it clarified that it has no intention of detaining any Lessor’s aircraft in Nigeria or anywhere else, the airline said its current issues with the trio of Smartlynx Airlines Malta Limited, SIA Smartlynx Airlines, and Smartlynx Estonia OU (jointly referred to as Smartlynx) stem from the operation of damp lease agreements involving four aircraft, during which Smartlynx deliberately defrauded Air Peace of several millions of dollars. This is in addition to the severe disruptions to the airline’s scheduled operations during peak season, resulting in monumental reputational and operational damage to the airline. “During the operation of the lease, Smartlynx deliberately defrauded Air Peace and fraudulently obtained several advance payments under the pretext that it would operate the agreed block hours. Smartlynx fully knew months before receiving these payments that it had no intention of operating the prepaid block hours, yet it continued to demand and receive payments from Air Peace under false pretences. “As of the date of this press statement, Air Peace’s total losses stand at USD 38, 042, 843. 84,” the airline said. In commemoration of the 2025 International Men’s Day, IHS Nigeria has hosted an outreach event at Ifesowapo Aboru Secondary School, Ipaja, Lagos State. The initiative was aimed at inspiring and empowering young students through conversations centered on leadership, respect, mental health, responsibility, and gender equity. Welcoming the IHS team to the school, Director and Principal of Ifesowapo Aboru Secondary School, Giwa Muyideen, expressed appreciation for the company’s ongoing commitment to educational advancement. “We are deeply honoured to have IHS Nigeria here to commemorate International Men’s Day with us. We thank them for what they have done, what they continue to do, and what they will yet do for our school and community, he said”. He further emphasized the importance of encouraging students to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), noting that such fields provide the strength and creativity needed to innovate and excel. In his introductory remarks, Associate Director, Legal, IHS Nigeria, Gbenga Bello, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to fostering positive values and supporting young people within its host communities. He explained that celebrating International Men’s Day in a school environment was intentional, as it provides an opportunity to engage boys at a formative age on themes of responsibility, leadership, and wellbeing. “International Men’s Day reminds us of the role men and boys play in building stronger, more compassionate societies. At IHS Nigeria, we believe that empowering young minds, especially through education, mentorship, and value-based conversations is one of the most meaningful ways we can contribute to our community. We are here because the future we want begins with the boys we guide today.” He said. The outreach featured two key sessions, an interactive discussion and a mentorship dialogue. The interactive session, facilitated by Morakinyo Fadipe, Associate Director, Human Resources at IHS Nigeria Limited, encouraged students to think critically about decision-making, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others. He emphasized that the choices they make ultimately shape who they become and that true leadership begins with self-awareness, responsibility, empathy, and respect in everyday actions. The mentorship dialogue, led by Adepoju Adebusayo, Senior Specialist, Human Resources at IHS Nigeria, focused on resilience, making wise choices, and modelling positive behaviour in society. He drew from personal experiences to remind students that challenges are opportunities for growth and stressed the importance of perseverance and consistent effort in achieving their goals. The event concluded with a heartfelt vote of thanks from Giwa Muyideen, who expressed deep appreciation for IHS Nigeria’s consistent support for educational development. He noted that the school is proud of its partnership with the company, describing IHS Nigeria as a reliable ally in empowering students and improving school facilities, and shared optimism for even greater collaboration in the future. This outreach is one of many initiatives under IHS Nigeria’s community development programs, which continue to support schools, promote gender balance, and nurture leadership skills among young Nigerians. As Nigeria accelerates toward the nationwide adoption of Computer-Based Testing (CBT) for the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) and National Examinations Council (NECO) examinations by 2026, schools across the country are under growing pressure to overhaul outdated infrastructure and invest in reliable digital solutions that meet regulatory standards. The Federal Government’s directive compelling both examination bodies to digitise their assessment systems is widely viewed as a milestone in modernising the education sector. However, it has also exposed a major concern: Nigeria’s schools are not uniformly equipped with the technology required to comply with the new testing model. From urban private schools to mission and rural institutions, administrators face similar challenges sourcing modern laptops, providing stable systems, staffing ICT units, and ensuring cybersecurity all while trying to control costs. In response to this national need, MENXTT Tech NG, an Ikeja-based ICT company with a growing footprint in the education sector, has positioned itself as a dependable solutions partner devoted to helping schools transition to CBT efficiently and affordably. Unlike vendors focused solely on sales, MENXTT Tech NG emphasizes long-term partnership, offering not just laptops but deployment-ready systems, advisory support and post-purchase service. According to the company’s Co-founder and Marketing Director, Anthony Emeka Nwosu, the transition requires more than just purchasing computers. “CBT readiness is about systems, security and sustainability. Schools need partners who understand testing environments, budgeting realities and long-term education goals. That’s where MENXTT Tech NG comes in.” The company supplies modern USA and EU-grade laptops, carefully tested for durability and examination performance. To eliminate additional financial burden for schools, the systems are competitively priced and delivered with warranty. Every laptop comes equipped with Windows 11 Operating System and is pre-installed with essential productivity software including Microsoft Office tools, typing tutors and learning programs, allowing institutions to deploy immediately without further spending on configuration or licensing. Recognizing cybersecurity as a major concern in examination environments, MENXTT Tech NG also includes licensed protection through its role as an authorised distributor of Bitdefender Internet Security Solutions in Nigeria. Each laptop delivered is secured with active antivirus software to protect systems against malware and cyber threats. “We deliver exam-ready machines, not empty metal shells,” Nwosu said. “Our systems arrive fully configured and secured, helping schools save time, money, and technical stress.” Beyond hardware supply, MENXTT Tech NG provides nationwide delivery, warranty fulfillment and technical guidance, ensuring schools in underserved locations receive equal access to ICT solutions. Education sector analysts say providers like MENXTT Tech NG will play a defining role in whether Nigeria’s CBT migration succeeds. “Government can set policy, but technology delivery will determine success,” one Lagos-based education consultant observed. “Schools must align with vendors that understand compliance and continuity.” With fewer than two academic cycles before full implementation, experts urge schools to abandon last-minute thinking and adopt phased transitions. MENXTT Tech NG says its mission extends beyond meeting minimum standards. “This is about building schools for the future, not just passing exams,” Nwosu emphasized. “We’re helping education leaders future-proof their institutions.” As the digital transformation of Nigeria’s examination system gathers pace, MENXTT Tech NG continues to gain recognition not merely as a supplier but as a trusted ICT ally to schools nationwide.",

            "content": "A Federal High Court in Lagos has issued a bench warrant for the arrest of Ade-Coker Suzan Motunrayo Odunola, a United Kingdom-based Nigerian woman, over an alleged ₦14. 3 million fraud. Justice Musa Kakaki granted the request Monday, following an application by Barrister Williams Tijani, prosecutor, of the Force Criminal Investigation Department (ForceCID) Annex, Alagbon-Ikoyi, Lagos. Odunola is standing trial in charge number FHC/L/983c/2025. Prosecutors allege that she obtained ₦14, 322, 172 from one Raphael Salisu under the false pretence of securing a United Kingdom certificate of sponsorship for him. The offences are said to contravene Section 1(1)(c) and are punishable under Section 1(3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act 2006, as well as Section 390 of the Criminal Code Act, LFN 2004. The case had come before the court on multiple occasions, but at the resumed hearing today, the prosecutor informed the judge that the defendant could not be located. He subsequently urged the court to issue a bench warrant, citing several legal authorities. Justice Kakaki granted the application and adjourned the case to 2 March 2026 for a report of compliance and the arraignment of the defendant. Teksight Edge has been named Winner of the “Innovative CSR Campaign of the Year” and Runner-Up in “CSR in Tech & Innovation” at the 2025 Social Impact and Sustainability Awards (SISA), organised by CSR Reporters, Africa’s foremost platform dedicated to corporate social responsibility, sustainability, and social impact excellence. The recognition celebrates Teksight Edge’s execution of the sustainability components of the E1 Lagos GP, the first-ever African edition of the global E1 Series, held on 2nd 5th of October 2025. The campaign blended high-impact storytelling with sport, environmental advocacy, digital innovation, and community engagement, using a data-driven communication strategy to amplify conversations around clean energy, climate resilience, waste-to-wealth initiatives, and inclusive sustainability participation across Lagos. According to CSR Reporters, “Teksight Edge was selected for its innovative, data-informed, and impact-driven approach to sustainability communication during the E1 Lagos GP. The evaluation panel noted that the agency’s work seamlessly integrated sport, environmental advocacy, community engagement, and digital storytelling to inspire public awareness on clean energy, climate resilience, and waste management. SISA commended Teksight Edge for demonstrating how CSR and sustainability messages can be communicated creatively, consistently, and with measurable impact across diverse audiences.” Speaking on the recognition, Odinaka Mbonu, General Manager of Teksight Edge, stated: “This award affirms our long-standing commitment to creating communication that inspires real change, strengthens brands, and creates measurable value. The E1 Lagos GP allowed us to demonstrate what is possible when communication, innovation, and purpose intersect, and we look forward to deepening this impact as we prepare for the next edition in 2026.” The SISA Awards, now in their sixth edition, honour organisations and leaders who demonstrate exceptional commitment to CSR, sustainability, and social performance across Africa. Teksight Edge’s recognition places the agency among a select group of innovators shaping the future of responsible and purpose-driven communication on the continent. This milestone strengthens Teksight Edge’s resolve to continue delivering communication strategies that elevate brands, empower communities, and drive meaningful societal progress, while setting new standards for creativity, innovation, and impact across industries. When investors are most unsure, they reach for assets that retain their value during market turmoil. For institutional and individual investors in Africa, including Nigeria, gold has been the go-to haven for several years. More recently, Bitcoin has been increasingly touted by its advocates as a digital alternative to gold because of its decentralized architecture, capped supply, and rising international profile. In reality, matters are far more nuanced. Although Bitcoin certainly constitutes a profoundly important development in the field of digital money, it is not a stable store of value at this time. Instead, its price dynamics more closely resemble those of risk assets, such as major stock indices and speculative technology stocks. Given the inflation pressures, currency devaluation, and exchange rate instability that encourage diversification beyond traditional financial instruments in Nigeria, the question is: Which asset can reliably preserve wealth? To understand what makes an asset a safe haven, one needs to be clear on the definition. A true safe haven preserves purchasing power during crises, maintains demand across economic cycles, and retains liquidity under stress. Gold has met these criteria time and time again throughout the centuries and across geopolitical events. Bitcoin, in relative contrast, has shown high volatility, strong correlation with global risk sentiment, and rapid speculative inflows and outflows. These characteristics position it closer to a high-risk growth asset than a defensive hedge. Why Gold Remains the Primary Safe-Haven Asset Gold has been a store of value for millennia. Its value is independent of any government, central bank, or digital infrastructure, and of any external platform. The price of gold mainly responds to currency weakness, geopolitical tension, and macroeconomic uncertainty. When inflation grows or currencies lose their purchasing power, gold usually appreciates. This can be clearly seen in Nigeria in recent years, as inflation and a weakening Naira have led to increased domestic demand for gold as a means of capital preservation. The stability of Gold is not accidental. Deep global liquidity, central bank participation, and sustained demand from industry and jewelry markets all underpin it. These structural characteristics reduce speculative volatility and create price behavior that, relatively speaking, is smoother during periods of global market stress. Bitcoin Has More With Risk Assets Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” because of its limited supply and decentralized architecture. However, it behaves more like a high-beta market instrument in terms of price action. When global markets are higher and technology stocks are outperforming, Bitcoin tends to appreciate strongly, while it declines with equity indices when risk sentiment is poor. For instance, during global risk-off events such as major central bank tightening cycles, Bitcoin has plunged along with stock markets. This is consistent with speculative capital exiting high-volatility assets first when liquidity tightens. A safe-haven asset should behave differently. It should either remain stable or appreciate during market uncertainty, not decline with broader markets. Bitcoin’s sensitivity to leverage conditions, liquidity cycles, and risk appetite precludes it from being viewed as a defensive portfolio asset at this time. It remains a speculative growth asset, with its price driven by sentiment, innovation cycles, and capital flows from both retail and institutional traders seeking momentum opportunities. Nigeria’s Inflation and the Search for Stability The Nigerian economy has experienced its fair share of runaway inflation, currency turmoil, and foreign-exchange pressure. Against this backdrop, the difference between a speculative asset and a true store of value becomes material. Most Nigerians like Bitcoin because it is accessible, internationally mobile, and free from local currency constraints. Features like these make Bitcoin a valuable alternative for transactions and savings, especially when access to banking is limited or capital controls limit currency movement. However, the ability to move capital does not translate into its value being preserved. Wealth protection requires stability. Gold provides this stability through centuries of price memory and broad demand. Bitcoin offers mobility and the growth potential, but mobility must not be confused with safety. Complementary Rather Than Substitutive Roles Gold and Bitcoin do not compete directly; they serve different roles within a portfolio. Gold is a foundational asset for stability, while Bitcoin can be used as a speculative vehicle, diversification tool, or to get exposure to digital innovation, but only as a controlled percentage of one’s capital. For most traders and investors, Bitcoin is an appropriate allocation, balanced by assets that maintain value regardless of global liquidity conditions. A common framework amongst professional portfolio managers today is to consider gold a core defensive asset and Bitcoin a satellite holding of high conviction, which is sized according to one’s personal risk tolerance. Stability vs Growth Potential Gold stores value through stability and resilience in the long term. Bitcoin offers potential growth, but it is highly volatile and sensitive to global risk sentiment. For both investors and traders that want to protect capital while maintaining strategic flexibility in Nigeria, these will make a difference. Understanding the respective role of each asset leads to better portfolio construction and more sustainable financial outcomes. Bitcoin is a powerful innovation and an important part of modern financial evolution. Gold remains the foundation for wealth preservation.

Don’t allow rich people to hide, because the system will collapse,” he said. Oyedele lamented the high level of misinformation surrounding the new tax regime, scheduled to take effect from 1 January 2026. “If you go on the street now and ask any young person, they will tell you there’s a 30 per cent tax in the capital market, because that’s what they’ve been told,” he said.

Oliver Alawuba, group managing director, United Bank for Africa and also chairman the Body of Bank CEOs, has assured banks’ customers of a steady cash supply across all branches and restated that the nation’s banking system remains safe. This is coming as Nigerians gear up for the year-end season. Alawuba, also noted that, for the banking industry to continue supporting sectors that can grow the economy, loan assets must be treated with discipline. While observing that the festive season is fast approaching, Alawuba, assured Nigerians on behalf of bank CEOs that “We are fully mobilised, in partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria, to ensure cash availability at branches. We will also make sure that during this period, all our digital touchpoints will work seamlessly so that you can have a smooth season.” He maintained that the federal government’s ambition of building a one-trillion-dollar economy is a national priority that requires deeper reform, enhanced continuity, and inclusive growth. According to him, the banking industry remains committed to expanding credit to the private sector. “I believe the private sector is so important. Today, the private sector lending position is about N74 trillion. We can do a lot more. We need to improve economic growth by providing more credit to the private sector. In providing this credit, we require responsive and responsible borrowing, time-dependent and properly managed frameworks,” he said. “But bank credit is not a gift. Bank credit is not a grant. Bank credit is not to fund a lifestyle. It is a trust between the bank and the customer, benefiting both the industry and the country. Banks do not sell money. If banks lend money and the money comes back, I believe that we can fund the growth sectors of the economy, “he added. While commending the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Federal Ministry of Finance for what he described as coordinated efforts that have helped stabilise the economy in recent months, he said, the impact of policy alignment between fiscal and monetary authorities was already evident in key indicators. He noted that the inflation, which had previously spiked, has dropped to 16 per cent as of October. He added that the official foreign exchange market has also witnessed improved stability, with the naira now trading within a narrow band. Alawuba further pointed out that SMEs contribute nearly half of the country’s economic output and more than 80 per cent of jobs, stressing that the sector cannot be allowed to fail. He also emphasised the role of women in achieving inclusive growth and urged banks to continue expanding access to financing for women-owned businesses. He identified the creative industry as another growth frontier. He cited the banking sector’s support for the revitalisation of the National Theatre as an example of the opportunities emerging within the industry. The UBA chairman reaffirmed the commitment of bank CEOs to professional conduct, compliance and ethical engagement with customers.

            "content": "Embedded devices from ATMs and point-of-sale systems to computerised medical equipment which offer quick rewards through both direct financial gain and access to valuable sensitive data have become regular targets for cybercriminals. The use of sophisticated tactics, techniques and procedures once limited to high-profile threat actors has become accessible to a wider range of attackers, creating an urgent need for more advanced protection. With this in mind, Kaspersky has released a significant update to its Kaspersky Embedded Systems Security (KESS) solution, expanding its behavioural analysis capabilities and reinforcing multiple protective layers designed specifically for low-power and legacy embedded devices. The new release introduces an enhanced behavioural analysis capability. The technology at its core powers critical features such as Automatic Exploit Prevention, a Remediation Engine and an improved Anti-Cryptor. Together, these subsystems enable the solution to detect even the most complex threats, including those relying on subtle, evasive techniques to bypass statistical or static detection mechanisms or sidestep hardening-based countermeasures typical in embedded environments. The overarching objective is to ensure that embedded devices can access protection mechanisms previously available only to full-scale endpoints. In addition to powerful behavioural defences, this update introduces several features specifically relevant to the unique challenges of embedded environments. Among the most relevant is BadUSB attack prevention, which blocks malicious USB devices attempting to masquerade as keyboards or other human-input peripherals to execute unauthorised commands. KESS now includes a proprietary application-level firewall that gives organisations tighter control over how embedded applications communicate with external peers, reducing exposure to unwanted or suspicious network interactions. Another practical enhancement is the new “traffic-light” Security Level Indicator, which instantly shows a device’s overall security posture and helps operators quickly determine whether additional attention or adjustments are required. Unlike generic endpoint protection or hardening-only solutions, KESS is built for the realities of the diversity of embedded systems. It supports very old and low-performance devices, operates reliably in low-bandwidth environments, and minimises reliance on the cloud¹. Its opt-in approach to threat protection enables organisations to balance pure hardening for low-end or legacy devices with full-spectrum security for more powerful, newer ones. It also integrates seamlessly into Kaspersky’s unified ecosystem with centralised management and consistent policies across diverse device fleets. “Embedded systems are no longer isolated or too limited to be worth targeting. They face the same sophisticated threats as traditional endpoints, but protecting them requires addressing their specific constraints,” says Oleg Gorobets, Cybersecurity Expert at Kaspersky. “This updated solution gives organisations stronger, smarter, more flexible protection while keeping operational complexity low. As embedded infrastructures continue to grow, so does the need for security that is both lightweight and deeply effective and this KESS update delivers exactly that.” By Abimbola Tooki Convocation lectures are usually remembered for polished grammar, polite applause, and the ritual dash for refreshments. The one delivered at Federal University of Wukari was remembered for something else entirely: it stirred the head, touched the heart, and then, most unexpectedly, opened a notebook and wrote a cheque to the future. When Professor Nentawe Goshwe Yilwatda, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress and former Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Reduction, mounted the podium to deliver the Convocation lecture, he did not arrive merely as a party leader or former cabinet member. He arrived as a witness, one who had walked through displacement camps, listened to widows with no ID but plenty of pain, and seen farmers whose greatest tragedy was not hunger alone, but invisibility. He also came with something rarer in academic halls: proof that ideas mean little unless they are funded, tested, and set free. When Technology Stops Being Smart and Starts Being Kind Professor Yilwatda wasted no time dismantling the comfort of abstraction. Nigeria’s poverty figures, he reminded the audience, are not PowerPoint decorations. According to national data, over 133 million Nigerians live in multidimensional poverty. But what gave the figures flesh was how he translated them into faces: the widow in Gusau locked out of microcredit because she has no formal ID, the Taraba graduate with talent but no bandwidth, the Borno farmer whose farm disappeared before government even noticed his name. He spoke not like a distant policymaker, but like someone who had dust on his shoes: from displacement camps in Borno to widows in Sokoto and Zamfara, from farmers in Benue plains to the hills of Plateau. At one point he joked that technology, like power, is useless if there is no socket to plug it into, eliciting laughter before delivering the punchline: millions of Nigerians are unplugged from opportunity, not by laziness, but by invisibility. Behind Nigeria’s shocking poverty figures, he insisted, are real lives stalled by the absence of identity, connectivity, and access. Poverty, he said memorably, is not gender-neutral, “it wears a woman’s face in rural Nigeria.” The room laughed, then nodded, then went quiet. From Global Lessons to Nigerian Reality With the ease of a seasoned lecturer, Professor Yilwatda travelled continents in minutes. Brazil showed how welfare becomes efficient when built on integrated digital registries. India demonstrated how identity transforms the poor from ghosts into citizens who cannot be ignored. His recurring refrain became a moral equation: where identity exists, visibility follows; where payments are digital, corruption loses its hiding place; where data is analysed early, disasters are prevented rather than mourned. Technology, he argued, is cheaper than sorrow and infinitely more humane when it arrives before tragedy. His takeaway was memorable, almost poetic: “Where identity becomes digital, governance becomes humane. When cash moves through code, corruption loses its shadow.” This was not theory for theory’s sake. He made the economics plain: digital social protection systems save money, reduce leakage, and expand trust. Inclusion, he argued, is not charity, it is fiscal intelligence with a human face. Nigeria’s Digital Compassion in Action Turning home, he peeled back the curtain on Nigeria’s own digital experiments: the National Social Register linking millions of households to identity and financial systems; community-driven rural targeting sitting side-by-side with satellite-powered urban mapping; and conditional cash transfers that have moved relief beyond pity into productivity. The most gripping story came from Ngala, Borno State, where displaced persons no longer queue like beggars but buy food like customers through e-wallets. Local farmers sell, vendors profit, families eat with dignity. “Aid,” he implied, “finally learned to behave like an economy.” Floods, Silence, and the Cost of Not Sharing Data His tone darkened as he recounted Nigeria’s flood disasters. The problem, he argued, is not absence of warnings but absence of coordination. Agencies gather forecasts, but systems do not talk. Data sits idle while water rises. He contrasted this with Pakistan’s anticipatory action model, where early warnings triggered early cash transfers and relocation, proving that preparation is not just cheaper than response, it is more humane. In a line that hung heavily in the hall, he observed that “silence between agencies often becomes suffering for citizens.” Universities as Rescue Laboratories Then came the pivot that made the lecture personal for the audience. Universities, Professor Yilwatda declared, must stop being observers of national pain and become designers of national solutions. If ministries are engines, universities must be the foundries. Federal University of Wukari, he noted, is ideally positioned, surrounded by flood-prone and conflict-affected communities, to become a national hub for humanitarian innovation. Addressing the graduating students directly, his voice softened: their degrees, he said, are not certificates of escape but licences for service. “You are the generation,” he told them, “called to build systems that feel, algorithms that care, and policies that see the poor not as numbers but as neighbours.” He urged students and scholars to build systems that care as much as they compute, insisting that Nigeria’s greatest untapped resource is not oil, but youthful intelligence. From Words to Wallet: A Donation That Spoke Louder Than Applause And just as the audience thought the lecture was drawing to a dignified close, Professor Yilwatda did what few speakers ever do: he moved from rhetoric to resolve. In a moment that drew a standing ovation, he announced a ₦20 million donation to the university, turning philosophy into funding and vision into velocity. ₦10 million was committed to humanitarian analytics research, to help scholars transform raw data into life-saving insights. ₦5 million was earmarked to provide solar solutions for the university thereby powering ideas that align sustainability with development. Another ₦5 million went directly to the Faculty of Social Sciences, tasked with developing practical solutions to Nigeria’s humanitarian and development challenges. It was not charity, he made it clear; it was an investment. An investment in intellect, innovation, and institutions that must outlive political tenures. Data as Redemption, Youth as Builders In his charge to the graduating students, Professor Yilwatda sounded less like a politician and more like a mentor. Degrees, he said, are not passports to comfort but call-up letters to service. This generation must build algorithms that care, dashboards that warn, and policies that remember the poorest first. He closed with words that felt both hopeful and demanding: data, when guided by compassion, becomes redemption; technology, when married to empathy, becomes conscience. Long after the gowns were folded and the hall emptied, one takeaway lingered in Wukari: this was more than a lecture. It was a reminder that nations do not fail for lack of ideas, but for lack of courage to fund them, test them, and trust their young people to carry them forward. And on that day, compassion did not just speak, it signed, sealed, and invested in the future. Tooki is a founder/editor, communication strategist and public relations expert.

The Federal Government on Friday intensified its regional security posture and modernised its identity management architecture with the official rollout of the ECOWAS National Biometric Identity Card ENBIC, marking a decisive push against transborder crimes, irregular migration and document fraud across West Africa. The launch makes Nigeria the seventh ECOWAS country to operationalise the card, a project conceived by the regional bloc 11 years ago but now revived under what officials described as President Bola Tinubu’s “renewed leadership and insistence on results.” Speaking at the ceremony, Minister of Interior, Dr Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, said the ENBIC rollout heralds “a powerful new beginning” for secure mobility and regional integration, noting that the delay of more than a decade was uncharacteristic of Nigeria’s capacity. He said, “It is unlike the Nigerian standard. That is very unsual, but the good news is that President Tinubu came in, insisted on delivery, and today the promise has become a reality. This is leadership in action, not about what we will do but what we have done.” Tunji-Ojo described the biometric card as the foundation of a new security and identity ecosystem that will transform intelligence gathering and border control. “You cannot protect who you do not know. Identification is the bedrock of security,” he said, explaining that the card will help tackle irregular migration, integrate with global public key directories like ICAO, and relieve pressure on Nigeria’s passport system by providing ECOWAS-bound travellers with a simpler alternative. “If you are not travelling outside ECOWAS, you don’t need a passport. This card takes you anywhere within the region,” he said. He also linked the initiative to wider reforms championed by President Tinubu, including the 2024 deployment of the UN-mandated Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS), which allows authorities to know travellers before they arrive. “This government inherited problems but refused to give excuses. It has straightened situations others postponed,” he said. The minister added that the Immigration Service will next unveil the Single Travel Emergency Passport STEP in January to help stranded Nigerians return home seamlessly. With the formal introduction of the ECOWAS National Biometric Identity Card, the minister said Nigeria is not only strengthening its borders but also reasserting its leadership in a region seeking deeper unity, safer mobility and a digital future built on shared prosperity. Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator George Akume, represented by Permanent Secretary Mohammed Sanusi Danjuma, situated the rollout within Nigeria’s long-standing leadership in regional integration. He recalled that the blueprint for the biometric system was first agreed at an ECOWAS summit hosted by Nigeria in 2014, adding that Friday’s launch “stands as a monument to shared political will” and proof of what West Africa can achieve when nations place collective security above individual interests. He said the card represents far more than a digital credential. “Today we hold in our hands a simple card, but in our hearts we hold a profound hope,” he said, describing it as a symbol of dignity for migrant women, empowerment for cross-border traders, and a promise of a West Africa where borders become “bridges to opportunity rather than barriers to progress.” Akume urged member states to accelerate nationwide rollouts and to harmonise databases to create an interoperable identity architecture across the sub-region. He also called on the private sector, especially fintechs, to build innovative services around the platform to deepen inclusion and drive digital transformation. In her remarks, Comptroller-General of Immigration, Kemi Nandap, said the milestone is both technical and historic. “This is a strategic leap forward in modernising our identity and travel management systems,” she said, praising President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda and commending the Interior Minister’s “dynamic guidance” in bringing the project to completion. She explained that the ENBIC replaces the paper-based ECOWAS travel certificate and is built on advanced biometric and cryptographic technology compliant with ICAO and ECOWAS standards. “Its biometric core, anchored on high-quality facial and fingerprint data, establishes a secure link between the holder and the credential. It will enhance verification, reduce document fraud, and disrupt transborder criminal networks,” she said. Nandap said the socioeconomic benefits are equally significant, as the card empowers small-scale traders, improves labour mobility, boosts tourism, speeds up border processing and strengthens cooperation across the region. “It is a foundational instrument for a more secure, integrated and prosperous West Africa,” she said. President of the ECOWAS Commission, Dr Omar Touray, praised Nigeria for once again providing leadership at a moment when the region faces grave security challenges. “In this world crisis, the leadership of Nigeria inspires all the citizens of West Africa,” he said through a representative. He disclosed that ECOWAS forces were currently in Guinea-Bissau, preventing conflict and saluted Nigeria’s role in regional peace and development. He projected that by the year 2100, Nigeria would be among the world’s top five economies, adding that “this initiative is only the beginning” of a region-wide biometric identity ecosystem. Chief of Mission of the International Organization for Migration IOM, Dimanche Sharon, described the ENBIC as “a very strategic step towards secure mobility,” saying it would greatly enhance identity verification and migration governance across the sub-region. The rollout was witnessed by paramilitary service chiefs, the Director General of the Department of State Services, ECOWAS commissioners, diplomatic corps members, and technology partners who collaborated on the project.",

            "content": "A large new study has found that children who receive smartphones at a young age are more likely to experience mental and physical health problems, including depression, poor sleep, and obesity. The research, published on Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics, studied more than 10, 000 children aged 12 across the United States. It showed that children who were given smartphones earlier than their peers were more likely to report emotional difficulties and unhealthy habits. Dr. Ran Barzilay, lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the findings provide clear evidence that early smartphone ownership may affect a child’s development. “For years, parents have been advised to delay giving smartphones to children, but there was little large-scale data available to support that guidance,” Barzilay said in a statement. “This study helps provide that evidence using a national sample of children.” The researchers did not examine how long the children spent on their phones or which applications they used. However, the study found a consistent pattern: children who had access to smartphones at younger ages were more likely to sleep fewer hours each night, show signs of depression, and have higher body weight. Health specialists said smartphones can interfere with sleep because children often use them in bed. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that poor sleep in young people increases the risk of learning problems, accidents, obesity, and mental health disorders. Experts also said social media can increase feelings of inadequacy among young users. “Children are frequently exposed to unrealistic images and lifestyles online,” Barzilay said. “ This can lead them to believe that they are not as successful or happy as others, even when that is not true. The study’s authors advised families to consider delaying smartphones and suggested alternatives such as basic mobile phones or smartwatches. They also recommended keeping phones out of children’s bedrooms at night and encouraging participation in sports and other physical activities. Parents are also advised to speak openly with their children about what they see online and to offer support if they experience bullying or emotional distress. The researchers said further studies will be needed to examine how smartphone content and screen time length affect children’s health, but they emphasized that early access alone appears to be an important factor. National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) has revealed that terrorist groups operating in the country have migrated from conventional mobile networks to satellite-based communication systems. Dr. Matthew Adepoju, director general, NASRDA, disclosed this weekend while appearing on Channels Television’s Politics Today. He warned that shutting down mobile networks during security operations no longer disrupts terrorist activities, as criminal groups now rely on more sophisticated satellite channels. “It breaks my heart when state governments shut down communication on our mobile phones, because most of them are not actually communicating through mobile networks. They are making it through the satellite platform. The terrorists are using satellites to communicate,” Adepoju said. He noted that many Nigerians misunderstand the capabilities of the country’s existing satellites, explaining that they are designed for imaging-not real-time video surveillance. “Sometimes, there’s a misconception about what satellites should do and what they have the capacity to do. The one the military has and the one we’ve launched in the agency are imagers. They don’t record videos, and they travel around the globe,” he said. Adepoju explained that Nigeria’s current satellites-NigeriaSat-1, NigeriaSat-X and NigeriaSat-2-require an average of three days to revisit the same location, making rapid response to fast-moving security threats difficult. He said a new satellite constellation approved by President Bola Tinubu would reduce revisit time to between four and six hours, depending on orbital placement. The agency, he added, plans to continuously expand the fleet with four or five additional satellites to achieve near real-time monitoring capacity. “If you want to have global coverage, we need to launch plenty of them into orbit. As one is going, another is coming. That’s why we went for the constellation of the four that the president has approved for us,” he said. The NASRDA DG also disclosed that the agency has secured an agreement with a U. S.-based technical partner operating nearly 300 satellites capable of providing advanced signal analytics to enhance Nigeria’s intelligence capabilities. However, the platform remains inaccessible because funds required to activate the partnership have not been released. Facebook has delivered a culturally relevant experience at the recently concluded AprokoNation Fiesta 2025, engaging thousands of young Nigerians through immersive activities and creator‑driven interactions. The activation highlighted how young adults in Nigeria use Facebook to explore their interests, discover new opportunities and connect meaningfully with others. Oluwasola Obagbemi, Head of Communications, Sub‑Saharan Africa at Meta, said the event underscored Facebook’s role as a leading platform for conversations around cultural moments. “Events like the AprokoNation Fiesta offer a powerful opportunity to create spaces where young adults can get together with friends and make new connections around health, wellness and fitness,” Obagbemi said. The Facebook Wellness Booth, hosted by influencer Eni Adeoluwa, featured interactive creator moments and engaging social activities. Attendees also enjoyed the Reels Booth, where they captured short‑form videos, alongside Facebook‑themed games that added excitement to the festival. Adeoluwa described hosting the wellness booth as “truly exciting,” noting that Facebook has helped him build meaningful connections with his audience. The Y2K‑themed activation brought together nostalgia and innovation, creating a vibrant space for content creators such as Emanuella Samuel, Gina Ehikodi, Dr. Chinonso Egemba (popularly known as Aproko Doctor), and Elozonam to interact with fans and grow their presence on the platform. AprokoNation Fiesta, an annual wellness event, continues to tap into Nigeria’s rising health culture by encouraging young adults to embrace healthy living through games, music and community bonding. The GSMA has released a major new independent study, The Impact of Cybersecurity Regulation on Mobile Operators, revealing that mobile operators are spending between US $15-19 billion annually on core cybersecurity activities, a figure expected to rise to US $40-42 billion by 2030. Despite this significant investment, mobile network operators, who form the backbone of digital economies worldwide, are impacted by poorly designed, misaligned or overly prescriptive regulation, which results in unnecessary costs, diverting resources from genuine risk mitigation, and in some cases increasing exposure to cyber threats. Michaela Angonius, GSMA Head of Policy and Regulation, said: “Mobile networks carry the world’s digital heartbeat. As cyber threats escalate, operators are investing heavily to keep societies safe but regulation must help, not hinder, those efforts. “This report makes clear that cybersecurity frameworks work best when they are harmonised, risk-based and built on trust. When done poorly, regulation can redirect critical resources away from real security improvements and toward compliance for its own sake.” A global perspective Developed in partnership with Frontier Economics, the report draws on economic analysis and operator interviews representing the Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and North America regions. It highlights how the fast-changing nature of cyber threats is driving up the costs and complexity for mobile operators across the globe, making collaboration between governments in different jurisdictions and engagement with industry vital in avoiding unnecessary costs for those operators present in multiple markets. Policy misalignment is creating unnecessary burdens: The study identifies widespread challenges across markets, including: Fragmented and inconsistent regulation, forcing operators to comply with overlapping or contradictory requirements from multiple agencies. A proliferation of reporting obligations, sometimes requiring the same incident to be reported multiple times in different formats. Prescriptive “box-ticking” rules that mandate tools or processes rather than focusing on real-world security outcomes. One operator reported that up to 80% of their cybersecurity operations team’s time is spent on audits and compliance tasks, rather than threat detection or incident response. Despite these pressures, operators emphasised that ensuring safe and secure mobile networks is a priority for their customers and for society as a whole in a digitally connected world. Six principles for effective cybersecurity regulation: The report outlines a blueprint for governments and policymakers to build more secure and efficient frameworks, and design cybersecurity policies according to six core principles: Harmonisation: Align cybersecurity policy with international standards where possible, to reduce regulatory fragmentation and inconsistency. Consistency: Ensure new policies and frameworks are consistent with existing policy to avoid duplication or conflict. Risk- and outcome-based: Adopt risk- and outcome-based approaches in the design and implementation of cybersecurity regulation, giving operators flexibility to innovate. Collaboration: Promote a collaborative regulatory culture with industry, supported by secure threat intelligence sharing. Security-by-design: Encourage a proactive, security-by-design approach to mitigating cyber risks. Capacity-building: Strengthen the institutional capacity of cybersecurity authorities to ensure a whole-of-government approach and effective application of policy and regulation. The report warns that unilateral, fragmented approaches heighten vulnerabilities and create inefficiencies for global operators. Michaela Angonius added: “Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. To protect citizens and critical societal services, regulators and operators should work together, guided by a common set of principles. When policy is coherent and outcomes-focused, the entire digital ecosystem becomes safer.” A call for coordinated global action: The mobile industry, supported by the GSMA, is calling on governments and regulators to minimise unnecessary burdens on mobile operators by collaborating and building trusted frameworks and mechanisms that foster innovation to enable mobile networks to remain secure, resilient, and capable of supporting the digital services that societies increasingly rely on.",

Don’t allow rich people to hide, because the system will collapse,” he said. Oyedele lamented the high level of misinformation surrounding the new tax regime, scheduled to take effect from 1 January 2026. “If you go on the street now and ask any young person, they will tell you there’s a 30 per cent tax in the capital market, because that’s what they’ve been told,” he said. He highlighted significant reforms targeting the capital market aimed at boosting participation and attracting investments. These reforms exempt portfolios and sales under N150 million which covers about 99 per cent of investors from capital gains tax, encouraging small and medium investors to stay engaged in the market without tax burdens. Oliver Alawuba, group managing director, United Bank for Africa and also chairman the Body of Bank CEOs, has assured banks’ customers of a steady cash supply across all branches and restated that the nation’s banking system remains safe. This is coming as Nigerians gear up for the year-end season. Alawuba, also noted that, for the banking industry to continue supporting sectors that can grow the economy, loan assets must be treated with discipline. While observing that the festive season is fast approaching, Alawuba, assured Nigerians on behalf of bank CEOs that “We are fully mobilised, in partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria, to ensure cash availability at branches. We will also make sure that during this period, all our digital touchpoints will work seamlessly so that you can have a smooth season.” He maintained that the federal government’s ambition of building a one-trillion-dollar economy is a national priority that requires deeper reform, enhanced continuity, and inclusive growth. According to him, the banking industry remains committed to expanding credit to the private sector. “I believe the private sector is so important. Today, the private sector lending position is about N74 trillion. We can do a lot more. We need to improve economic growth by providing more credit to the private sector. In providing this credit, we require responsive and responsible borrowing, time-dependent and properly managed frameworks,” he said. “But bank credit is not a gift. Bank credit is not a grant. Bank credit is not to fund a lifestyle. It is a trust between the bank and the customer, benefiting both the industry and the country. Banks do not sell money. If banks lend money and the money comes back, I believe that we can fund the growth sectors of the economy, “he added. While commending the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Federal Ministry of Finance for what he described as coordinated efforts that have helped stabilise the economy in recent months, he said, the impact of policy alignment between fiscal and monetary authorities was already evident in key indicators. He noted that the inflation, which had previously spiked, has dropped to 16 per cent as of October. He added that the official foreign exchange market has also witnessed improved stability, with the naira now trading within a narrow band. Alawuba further pointed out that SMEs contribute nearly half of the country’s economic output and more than 80 per cent of jobs, stressing that the sector cannot be allowed to fail. He also emphasised the role of women in achieving inclusive growth and urged banks to continue expanding access to financing for women-owned businesses. He identified the creative industry as another growth frontier. He cited the banking sector’s support for the revitalisation of the National Theatre as an example of the opportunities emerging within the industry. The UBA chairman reaffirmed the commitment of bank CEOs to professional conduct, compliance and ethical engagement with customers. He also expressed concern about rising risks in the digital economy, particularly AI-driven fraud and cross-border cyberattacks. He said the Body of Bank CEOs will strengthen collaboration with the Central Bank, NIMC and other institutions to protect financial platforms and safeguard customers’ funds.",

            "content": "If that’s true, there’s little doubt that that second attack was illegal. The U. S. military is subject to all sorts of laws and regulations barring the intentional killing of enemies who have been disabled; the Pentagon’s own manual on the laws of war specifically cites firing on shipwrecked sailors as an example of a “clearly illegal” practice. At best, if we concede for argument’s sake that the survivors were combatants in an armed conflict, the second strike is a war crime. If they weren’t combatants, it’s out-and-out murder. No one involved in this process seems to know how to handle it. Except, interestingly, Pete Hegseth. Uncharted waters. In hindsight, the six Democrats who appeared in a video last week warning service members not to obey unlawful orders must have known about this incident. The timing is too coincidental to have been pure chance. How they knew is unclear. Possibly they were tipped off when the Post’s reporters began asking questions about it on Capitol Hill, but evidently information was trickling in through official channels as well. The paper claims that lawmakers received “two closed-door briefings” about the episode at some point in which the second strike was rationalized as having eliminated wreckage that would have, ahem, created a “navigation hazard.” The six Democrats may have found themselves in a bind. If they revealed what they knew about the incident, they would have been accused of leaking classified information and possibly pursued by Trump’s Justice Department. If they said nothing, more so-called “double tap” strikes might have been ordered and carried out. They didn’t know what to do, perhaps, so they compromised, posting a vague admonition that illegal orders are indeed illegal and hoping that those in the ranks who needed to hear that would hear it and take it to heart. Adm. Bradley may not have known what to do either. Surely he knew that a “no quarter” order is unlawful. According to the Post, even junior officers involved in the Caribbean strikes are sufficiently aware of how shady it is to have begun asking military lawyers for written authorization to protect themselves legally before participating. “Some have drawn distinctions between the traffickers and terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and have struggled to accept that alleged criminals meet the same threshold for lethal strikes,” the paper reported. An unspecified number are worried that they might need attorneys eventually. If they’re capable of smelling a rat, an admiral is too. But Bradley may have run up against the sort of postliberal conundrum that I described last week. If he followed the law by leaving survivors after Hegseth ordered him to kill everyone, he probably would have been relieved of command But the same advantages in impeaching Hegseth would apply here. The process would force Republicans to defend atrocities, impress upon the military that war crimes won’t be tolerated even when the president orders them, and focus public attention on the already unpopular practice of blowing up boats without knowing who’s on board. On the other hand, if Democrats start chattering about impeachment, they’ll tickle right-wingers’ tribal erogenous zones and risk a familiar “rally around the president” effect. Trump’s support might rise. And he’d suddenly have an excuse to change the subject from the economy, the issue that’s eating him alive. The best outcome might be one that’s only achievable through private, not public, channels. Getting the most dangerous man in the government out of the Pentagon would be a good result, but the president surely won’t fire Hegseth under public pressure from Democrats. Perhaps he’ll be more amenable if it’s conveyed to him informally that the new House majority will probe the September 2 episode aggressively next year, with multiple impeachments possible, unless he finds a pretext to get rid of Secretary Pete ASAP. There’s no shortage of better qualified candidates waiting in the wings; all the president has to do is find someone who doesn’t treat war crimes as a form of bravado. In a kakistocracy it’s too much to ask the head of state to surround himself with a few good men. But he can certainly surround himself with some slightly less bad ones.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) Since last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in the nation’s capital by a suspect who is an Afghan national, the Trump administration announced a flurry of policies aimed at making it harder for some foreigners to enter or stay in the country. The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries “of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U. S. war effort. Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U. S. during the Biden administration. The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed. The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country or are already here do not pose a security threat. Here’s a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week: All asylum decisions suspended The director of U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.” Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause. People seeking asylum must show to U. S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they’re granted asylum, they’re allowed to stay in the U. S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship. The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac. The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Department of Justice. While Trump’s January order didn’t affect those cases, Edlow’s social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency’s pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused. Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. The number of asylum cases at USCIS rose from 241, 280 in 2022 to a record 456, 750 in 2023, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. A focus on countries ‘of concern’ On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.” “American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said. The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U. S. longer. The administration had already banned travel to the U. S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others. No visas for Afghans Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans. On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U. S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U. S. Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports. The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U. S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America. But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed. According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U. S., about 180, 000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program. A review of refugees admitted under the Biden administration Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U. S. during the Biden administration as part of the U. S. Refugee Assistance Program. That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U. S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U. S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U. S. Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program. Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U. S. during the Biden administration. That’s nearly 200, 000 refugees. Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.",

Don’t allow rich people to hide, because the system will collapse,” he said. Oyedele lamented the high level of misinformation surrounding the new tax regime, scheduled to take effect from 1 January 2026. “If you go on the street now and ask any young person, they will tell you there’s a 30 per cent tax in the capital market, because that’s what they’ve been told,” he said. He highlighted significant reforms targeting the capital market aimed at boosting participation and attracting investments. These reforms exempt portfolios and sales under N150 million which covers about 99 per cent of investors from capital gains tax, encouraging small and medium investors to stay engaged in the market without tax burdens. Oliver Alawuba, group managing director, United Bank for Africa and also chairman the Body of Bank CEOs, has assured banks’ customers of a steady cash supply across all branches and restated that the nation’s banking system remains safe. This is coming as Nigerians gear up for the year-end season. Alawuba, also noted that, for the banking industry to continue supporting sectors that can grow the economy, loan assets must be treated with discipline. While observing that the festive season is fast approaching, Alawuba, assured Nigerians on behalf of bank CEOs that “We are fully mobilised, in partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria, to ensure cash availability at branches. We will also make sure that during this period, all our digital touchpoints will work seamlessly so that you can have a smooth season.” He maintained that the federal government’s ambition of building a one-trillion-dollar economy is a national priority that requires deeper reform, enhanced continuity, and inclusive growth. According to him, the banking industry remains committed to expanding credit to the private sector. “I believe the private sector is so important. Today, the private sector lending position is about N74 trillion. We can do a lot more. We need to improve economic growth by providing more credit to the private sector. In providing this credit, we require responsive and responsible borrowing, time-dependent and properly managed frameworks,” he said. “But bank credit is not a gift. Bank credit is not a grant. Bank credit is not to fund a lifestyle. It is a trust between the bank and the customer, benefiting both the industry and the country. Banks do not sell money. If banks lend money and the money comes back, I believe that we can fund the growth sectors of the economy, “he added. While commending the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Federal Ministry of Finance for what he described as coordinated efforts that have helped stabilise the economy in recent months, he said, the impact of policy alignment between fiscal and monetary authorities was already evident in key indicators. He noted that the inflation, which had previously spiked, has dropped to 16 per cent as of October. He added that the official foreign exchange market has also witnessed improved stability, with the naira now trading within a narrow band. Alawuba further pointed out that SMEs contribute nearly half of the country’s economic output and more than 80 per cent of jobs, stressing that the sector cannot be allowed to fail. He also emphasised the role of women in achieving inclusive growth and urged banks to continue expanding access to financing for women-owned businesses. He identified the creative industry as another growth frontier. He cited the banking sector’s support for the revitalisation of the National Theatre as an example of the opportunities emerging within the industry. The UBA chairman reaffirmed the commitment of bank CEOs to professional conduct, compliance and ethical engagement with customers. He also expressed concern about rising risks in the digital economy, particularly AI-driven fraud and cross-border cyberattacks. He said the Body of Bank CEOs will strengthen collaboration with the Central Bank, NIMC and other institutions to protect financial platforms and safeguard customers’ funds.",

            "content": "Germany’s corrupt, globalist political establishment keeps gaslighting the public, saying everything is “under control,” and all is good, but new medical data has revealed the country is spiraling deeper and deeper into chaos as knife violence explodes to levels once unimaginable. Trauma surgeons have sounded the alarm. Severe stabbing injuries requiring emergency care have surged by 50% in just four years-an unprecedented escalation tied directly to the suicidal mass-immigration experiment that Germany’s globalist class has imposed on the rest of the nation. For the first time, medical specialists isolated cases where victims were intentionally stabbed, and the results reveal thousands of attacks that expose the true scale of the crisis the increasingly unpopular left and right globalist governments have tried to downplay. Over the last decade, hospitals logged 3, 325 violent knife wounds, with the most dramatic rise occurring following the 2015-2025 migration wave championed by globalist politicians and the left-wing media, Die Welt reported. In 2019, roughly 250 people were rushed into emergency rooms with life-threatening stab wounds. Shockingly, by 2023 the number had spiked to nearly 375-proof of a country where violence is becoming part of everyday life. Doctors warn that attackers-often foreign nationals and migrants who shouldn’t be in Germany-are not just more numerous, but more vicious, deliberately striking the throat and chest, areas where a single stab can sever an artery or collapse a lung in seconds. One veteran trauma surgeon described it like this: “Knives are being used casually and intentionally, more than ever before.” His words mirror what Germans increasingly witness on a daily basis. Most victims are young men, but the real story is the brutality. Over 70% require immediate emergency intervention, and 8% die in hospital despite medical teams fighting to save them. Experts have stated openly what the entrenched, ruling class refuses to acknowledge: Germany’s anti-national ‘elite’ has imported the knife violence. In many cultures from which recent migrants come, carrying and using knives is normalized, and as a result, the barrier to bloodshed is drastically lower. The result is a society where military-aged migrant men now carry knives as casually as smartphones, and more and more Germans arm themselves out of fear-something police warn will only fuel further violence. Even Germany’s police unions have begun to admit the truth: violence is becoming more extreme, and knives are being pulled over minor arguments, sidewalk bumps, or perceived slights and in most cases, it’s not native Germans doing the stabbing. Meanwhile, official crime data shows the same pattern: tens of thousands of knife crimes last year alone, with foreign nationals responsible for nearly half-a fact the mainstream media hides behind vague language and statistical gymnastics. Germany recorded 29, 014 knife-crime incidents, including over 15, 700 knife attacks, with serious stabbings rising almost 11% in a single year. Yet the political establishment-especially the Greens, SPD, and their activist allies-continue to deny any link between the open-border ideology and the bloody consequences unfolding across the country. As ordinary Germans grow more afraid to enter train stations, ride public transport, or attend festivals without passing concrete barricades and armed guards, it’s clear that the globalist system is collapsing under its own utopian fantasies. The AfD, Germany’s most popular party, remains the only major party telling the truth: Germany cannot survive if it continues importing the same violence, cultural norms, and criminality that wrecked other nations.",

            "content": "NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! California Gov. Gavin Newsom has an advantage with liberal Hollywood in his home state, and a new report shows he could be winning the early battle for the deep pockets of Tinseltown ahead of the 2028 Democratic primary. \"He’s a fighter, that’s what we need!\" a top-tier producer described as a \"reliable Dem ATM over the decades\" told Deadline. \"I just wish more Democrats, like [Chuck] Schumer and the leadership (in Congress), would emulate him, not take any s from Trump.\" Newsom has won plaudits on the left for his more pugnacious style toward President Donald Trump, trolling him on social media while also embracing new media platforms like podcasts and Substack. He also earned some love in progressive Hollywood for his fight for Prop 50, the amendment Californians passed easily last month that gerrymandered districts in favor of Democrats to offset Republican efforts in Texas. TRUMP-TROLLING GOV GAVIN NEWSOM SUGGESTS 'COIN' IS COMING TO ONLINE STORE: 'TRUMP CORRUPTION COIN' \"Donald Trump poked the bear. And the bear roared back,\" Newsom said of the win. \"I’ll admit, I didn’t see it in him, and I’ve met him a number of times, but Newsom has really impressed me the way he’s taken Trump on, the jabs,\" an agency executive told Deadline. The two-term governor said in October he would consider running for the presidency after the 2026 midterms. Newsom's even been praised by HBO's Bill Maher, who is never shy about criticizing Democrats he considers too far to the left. Former Obama U. S. Ambassador to Spain and HBO executive James Costos said Newsom had \"strong enthusiasm\" from Los Angeles donors. GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARED AS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S 2028 'FRONTRUNNER' BY POLITICO \"Big checks are being written,\" he told Deadline. \"It was a slow build early on as we recovered from the loss [last] November, but there has been momentum building, No Kings events, legal wins, the [Jimmy] Kimmel effect, resistance growing and it’s turning into clear ways to fight back against the administration’s overreach and organize to win in 2026 and 2028.\" Another \"big donor producer\" told Deadline that \"anyone who really matters\" wants to be sure to be on the Newsom train if and when it takes off. TRUMP FORCES INDIANA GOP INTO REDISTRICTING REVERSAL IN RACE TO DRAW NEW MAGA MAP Others quoted in the report expressed caveats about Newsom, noting it's still quite early in the 2028 primary process and some donors may be biding their time waiting for the best candidate. The field is expected to be crowded, with figures like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y., and even 2024 nominee Kamala Harris possibly throwing their hat in the ring.",

Francis Baasis, of the Diocese of Antipolo, shared the story online on Sunday, saying the driver told him protests at the EDSA People Power Monument involved “NPA” groups preparing to rally. Baasis said he replied, “Those aren’t NPA, kuya,” explaining that priests, bishops and parish groups organized the demonstrations to demand accountability in public funds. The driver insisted the clergy were “paid” to attack Vice President Sara Duterte a claim Baasis said reflected how widely false stories spread through social media. “The Church does not want to bring down the government,” Baasis said, adding that Church groups only want wrongdoing exposed and public funds protected from abuse. Baasis said the driver then softened, admitting, “I voted for Bongbong before. would they be willing to stake their souls?” a question that brought sudden silence from the driver, said Baasis, who is also former director of the Antipolo diocese’s social communications ministry. The priest said the driver remained quiet until the trip ended, and he hoped it meant the man was rethinking the stories shaping his views on national issues. Baasis said he left believing “a small crack” in false beliefs can let light in, especially at a time when truth and accountability matter to many Filipinos.",

WATCH BELOW: Vero Beach HS football team seeks first state since 1981 Vero Beach High School football team seeks first state since 1981 The Fighting Indians have dominated their playoff run, outscoring opponents 160-50 across three postseason victories. Now they're chasing something that hasn't happened since 1981 a state championship. \"You try to impress these guys with the fact that they'll be brothers for life, and these guys, no matter what they do, they will be brothers for life,\" Vero Beach head coach Lenny Jankowski said. The parallels between the 1981 title team and this year's group aren't lost on the current players. \"It's definitely inspiring. They tell us every day that it hasn't happened in years and years, and that's what's driving us,\" tight end Bobby Burbic said. The road to this moment began last winter with grueling preparation that has paid dividends throughout the season. \"It's been amazing, we started back in January (preparing for this season) . just grinding it out,\" offensive tackle Champ Smith said. That preparation has created an unbreakable bond among teammates who see themselves as more than just classmates. \"I definitely do feel the dominance we are working as a team really well this year, and we're jelling together, and we have an amazing brotherhood,\" Burbic said. If the Fighting Indians can secure a victory Friday night, they'll advance to the state championship game and have a chance to end their 44-year title drought. \"That would be incredible. I just want to finish up with a bang, that's the main thing,\" Smith said. Vero Beach takes on Miami Palmetto at 7 p. m. on Friday to determine who will play in the 7-A title game later this month.",

            "content": "The Greens are right about gas. Greens resources spokeswoman Steph Hodgins-May said Australia had ample supply and should use fiscal policy to steer more gas into the domestic system. “We don’t have a gas shortage, we have a gas export problem,” she said. The party is instead pushing for a 25 per cent levy on exporters a measure that would hit producers hard and, in practice, could encourage them to scale back output. The Australian last week revealed the government had previously considered such a tax.“A levy makes the problem worse,” one senior industry source said. “If you want supply, you don’t tax it.” No, it doesn’t. An export levy makes exporting gas less attractive and delivers an abundant local supply. The only problem with the Greens’ policy is that it is far too lax. A 25% export levy will equate to about $10. 50 for spot and $13. 50 for industry, with a decline of about $30MWh in wholesale power costs. These are still crazy high prices. The levy will raise roughly $5 billion, which could be recycled as permanent bill relief, dropping power prices by another $30, which the Greens should also insist upon. But that hardly makes for a fair tax take and will not be enough to stabilise gas-dependent industry. The levy should be 50% or set at 100% of every export dollar above $7Gj%. The cartel still pumps money at that level, noting that cash costs are much lower than the all-in costs in the below table. Meanwhile, we have a gas peaker at last! Queensland’s new energy road map isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but it has helped spark a $1 billion-plus investment in a new gas power plant that should be the envy of other states and their energy transition plans. The new Brigalow Peaking Power Plant, about 300 kilometres west of Brisbane, will be built alongside the Kogan Creek coal-fired power station, run by the government’s CS Energy, and used to firm up wind and solar power in morning and afternoon periods of peak demand. It can go from cold to full output in just five minutes. Australia’s APA Group, a gas pipeline and power infrastructure owner, has committed the first $800 million to build it, in return for an 80 per cent stake. It’s interesting because we hear a lot about gas peaking plants and how they’re required to firm up a grid that is supposed to be dominated by renewable power in coming decades. Why? It is all about returns and the willingness of parties like CS Energy, whose business is wholesale power, to develop and take long-term price risk or write contracts with someone like APA Group to do the developing (and co-investing) for them. It is also about flip-flopping government policy, which makes those long-term contracts even harder to write, and weak-stomached boards and investors who are more interested in next quarter’s earnings than next decade’s power. Rubbish. There is only one reason gas peaking plants are not going up all over the East Coast, and that is there is no security of supply or price with the gas cartel choking the supply of the fuel. Fix that, and you fix everything.",

            "description": "How was your long holiday weekend? Nice? A good time to chill with friends and family, right? Well, what if the day before your four-day vacation kicked off, you found out that you and your boss are on the hook for close to $1 million in sanctions? And what if, when you came back after that long weekend, you learned that you’re not legally eligible to be in the job that you’ve known you weren’t legally eligible to be in for months? That’s what happened to Alina Habba. Alina Habba speaks to the press at the White House on March 24. President Donald Trump tapped Habba as the acting U. S. attorney for New Jersey, knowing full well that the former parking lot lawyer was not going to be confirmed by the Senate despite having been one of Trump’s dozens of personal attorneys. Habba had the distinction of being the first-but by no means the last-Trump nominee to be ruled ineligible to serve in her job by a lower court. And now she also has the distinction of being the first Trump nominee to have a federal appellate court basically say, “Did the lower court stutter?” A three-judge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals showed no love for the government’s argument that, if Trump wants Habba to be a U. S attorney, then he gets to make her a U. S. attorney, laws be damned. Writing for the panel in affirming the lower court’s ruling, Judge D. Michael Fisher, a George W. Bush appointee, was a veritable master of understatement. \"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,” he ruled. Habba really should have seen the writing on the wall after the appellate oral arguments in the case, which did not go well. The federal courts should not have to painstakingly explain to Habba, Trump, and Attorney General Pam Bondi-all of whom bear equal responsibility for this mess-that, yes, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act is a law that they must follow. But it did anyway: Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U. S. Attorney indefinitely. This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional PAS [appointment and confirmation] process entirely. It also essentially eliminates the requirements of the FVRA and the U. S. Attorney-specific statute. Bondi learned last week that her One Weird Trick to propping up failed appointees is also not going to be a solution here. Bondi tried to save Lindsey Halligan-who stumbled into serving as acting U. S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia because of her willingness to do sham prosecutions for Trump-by backdating an appointment naming her as a special counsel instead. Attorney General Pam Bondi That resulted not just in Halligan being told she was illegally in her job but also in the tossing out of her two-and only-criminal cases. So Habba’s out of a government job. At least she can take her incredible talents and high success rate back to the private sector where she . whoops. The private sector is where she was just found by a different federal court to still owe nearly $1 million in sanctions for Trump’s unhinged RICO lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and more than two dozen others. Suffice it to say that the lower court called it a “completely frivolous” lawsuit and did not buy the argument that Clinton conspired with former FBI Director James Comey to direct a Trump prosecution, among a host of other nonsense. In affirming the lower court, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that Trump’s attorneys-looking at you, Habba-filed frivolous pleadings and that the court “did not clearly err in finding that Trump’s attorneys filed the amended complaint in bad faith.” A cartoon by Clay Bennett. “Trump’s attorneys give us no reason to conclude the district court clearly erred in that finding,” it found. So neither Trump nor Habba is out from under the nearly $1 million worth of sanctions imposed by the lower court, meaning they have to pay attorney fees to all of the defendants. And fun fact: the largest chunk goes to Clinton, at close to $172, 000. Since Habba represented him in her personal capacity in that lawsuit, she’s on the hook along with Trump, who brought the lawsuit in his personal capacity. Trump might somehow find a way to make an immunity argument that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts might buy, but it’s not likely to be extended to Habba. Better get back to being a parking lot lawyer, Alina. You’ll need to stack some cash to pay off that fine-and you know full well that Trump isn’t going to help.",

            "content": "Last Call A prime-time read of what’s going down in Florida politics. First Shot Loranne Ausley will hold the first major fundraiser of her Tallahassee Mayor bid tomorrow, a reception at The Governor’s Inn that effectively serves as her formal campaign kickoff. The event comes a little over two months after she entered the race to replace current Tallahassee Mayor John Dailey, who is not running for re-election. Ausley’s return to politics follows a long recovery from a serious triathlon accident last fall that left her hospitalized for weeks. She has said her medical team has cleared her to campaign, and she’s been easing back into public life since filing in September. The former state Representative and Senator joins a field that already includes Commissioner Jeremy Matlow and civil rights attorney Daryl Parks. The nonpartisan race is particularly important because whoever wins could tip the balance in favor of one of the two competing factions on the current Commission. When she launched her campaign, Ausley avoided commenting directly on current Commission battles, stating she wanted to focus on “finding the things that we have in common versus focusing on things that we don’t have in common.” As of the close of the last campaign finance reporting period on Sept. 30, Parks led in overall fundraising with $88,527 on hand, followed by Matlow at $66,948 and Ausley at $63,380. Ausley’s fundraiser runs from 5-7 p. m. at the Governor’s Inn, 209 South Adams Street. ___ A coalition of voting-rights groups will gather at the Capitol for a news conference and day of action against the mid-decade redistricting push ahead of the Florida House Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting’s first meeting. Organizers of the “We Draw the Lines: No Partisan Maps” event say the message is simple: partisan gerrymandering is prohibited under Florida’s Fair Districts Amendments, and the state shouldn’t test the limits. “Any attempt by politicians to engage in drawing new voting maps designed to tip the scales of power for partisan gain is unconstitutional and illegal in Florida,” said Genesis Robinson, Executive Director of Equal Ground. “Redistricting decides who represents us in government, so it is critical that the process serves the people, not politicians.” The effort is timed to coincide with Tuesday’s inaugural Committee hearing, where members are expected to outline how they intend to approach a redraw of Florida’s congressional map. The state currently has a 20-8 Republican advantage in the Congressional delegation, and the controversial map, which went into effect for the 2022 elections, was upheld by the state Supreme Court in July. However, Gov. Ron DeSantis has made clear he wants the Legislature to look at the maps again ahead of the 2026 Midterms. President Donald Trump has called for red states to redraw their maps to preserve the slim GOP majority in the U. S. House, spurring an arms race in which both Republican- and Democratic-led states are seeking ways to tilt their maps further toward one party. The Day of Action begins with an 11 a. m. press event on the House side of the Fourth Floor Rotunda. Speakers will include Robinson, Southern Poverty Law Center Florida Policy Director Jonathan Webber, All Voting is Local Florida State Director Brad Ashwell and ACLU of Florida Senior Strategist Abdelilah Skhir. After the news conference, attendees plan to visit legislative offices to show lawmakers “that Floridians won’t stand for illegal political manipulation of our representation in Congress.” FEA President Andrew Spar, on a new state rule requiring college professors to submit a final syllabus 45 days before class starts.

Breakthrough Insights Tune In Magic try to stay hot against Bulls The Orlando Magic host the Chicago Bulls in a game that both teams need to stay in playoff contention nearing the quarterpost of the season (7: 30 p. m. ET, Peacock). Orlando has won eight of the last 10 games to climb to sixth in the Eastern Conference standings. If the season ended today, the Magic would automatically qualify for the playoffs. Coming off back-to-back wins at Philadelphia and Detroit, the Magic are a game behind the division-leading Miami Heat in the Southeast Division. Remarkably, the team has accomplished the run without star Paolo Banchero, who has missed eight straight games with a groin strain. Banchero is not expected to return for tonight’s game. Before the injury, Banchero averaged 21. 7 points, 8. 7 rebounds, and 4. 1 assists per game. In his stead, Franz Wagner has stepped up, leading Orlando in scoring (22. 8 points per game). Chicago is heading in the opposite direction, losing three straight and seven of the last 10 games. Losses at New Orleans, Charlotte, and Indiana opened the road trip, which continues tonight in Orlando. If the season ended today, the Bulls would be the last team to qualify for the play-in round of the playoffs. Tonight’s game is the first of three straight at home for the Magic, including a matchup with Miami on Friday in the NBA Cup. ___.",

            "content": "Sound the alarms-the internet’s concerned about a new entitled man online. Recommended Videos It started when Justin (@justinbarberfit), a content creator on TikTok, took to the platform to complain about women not talking to him in a video that’s gotten over 816, 000 views. “ Public service announcement,” the man said. “If you’re gonna pass a single guy on a trail and you’re a girl and he says hi, maybe say hi back and not just gimme an awkward [look].” Many viewers questioned how women were supposed to detect Justin’s single status from his greeting. Others simply pointed out how gross his entitlement to women’s time, energy, and attention was. Justin quickly got flamed in the comments section of his video, leading to some outraged video responses. “Justin, you could have just written this in your diary later,” said one commenter. Another added, “Justin is why they choose the bear,” referencing the man vs bear debate that ignited the internet in 2024. Since Justin posted on Nov. 17, TikTok content creators jumped on the bandwagon of making fun of Justin’s somewhat pretentious post. @justinbarberfit ♬ original sound Justin Why is what Justin said so laughable? To many, Justin’s comments felt incredibly out of touch considering how unsafe women feel in 2025. Unfortunately, there are countless stories where women entertain a simple greeting from a man, only to get harassed and borderline stalked on simple outings. For instance, two women walking on Lady Bird Lake Trail noticed a man following them along their route. They made simple small talk at first, but became more and more restless as he continued “showing up” wherever they went. In that regard, Justin’s rhetoric is potentially dangerous for women. They don’t owe him, or others, a conversation just because they chose to go out. The idea that they do oftentimes leads to escalated, violent situations. Justin’s comments also assume a romantic connection where there isn’t one. His out-of-touch line about “pass[ing] a single guy” points toward his desire to strike up a deeper conversation and flirt-not engage in common courtesy. He isn’t asking for a hi because it’s a nice thing to do. He’s asking for a “hi” to get more out of a woman who is probably completely uninterested. Most women don’t go on hiking trails to find single men. They go to enjoy a relaxing day outdoors. A trend gets born The current trend is in, and it’s responding to-or making fun of-Justin. TikTok users like James Cappola expressed frustration and borderline outrage at Justin’s entitlement. “Oh forgive them captain [expletive].[These women hikers] didn’t know they were in the presence of royalty. They don’t owe you [expletive].” Others mocked Justin’s tone, like @most. smartest, who directly quoted the original video and added some scathing additions. So far, tens of content creators have responded to Justin’s video. Some responses directly examine why they’d choose “the bear” over Justin, while others point out how Justin continuing to keep his TikTok video up normalizes bad behavior and general entitlement. @most. smartest #mostsmartest #singleguy #hikingtrail #justinbarberfit #singleladies ♬ original sound Most Smartest The Mary Sue has reached out to Justin for comment.",

So popular, in fact, that my mom, over the years, has developed techniques to make these little treats more efficiently, since she usually makes hundreds. Freezing the muffin tins, using a tart tamper, and squeezing out the filling will help you speed your tassie production. Because once you make these, you will be making more. Promise. Yields 24. Crust: 3 oz cream cheese, room temperature ½ c (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1 c all-purpose flour Pinch of kosher salt Filling: ¾ c packed dark brown sugar 1 egg, room temperature 1 T unsalted butter, melted Pinch salt 1 t vanilla bean paste or extract 2 t bourbon or maple syrup (optional) ¾ c chopped pecans Spray a 24-count mini muffin tin (or two 12-count mini muffin tins). Place in the freezer while you make dough. In stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth, about 3 minutes. Slowly add in the flour and salt, mix until dough comes together. Turn dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Shape dough into a rectangle and wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour (can be made 2 days ahead and kept refrigerated). Preheat the oven to 350. Remove dough from the refrigerator and divide rectangle into 24 cubes of dough. Roll each into a ball and press into the bottom and up the sides of each mini muffin cup (a mini tart tamper is useful here, but your fingers will work too). Transfer pan to the freezer (or refrigerator) while you make the filling. Combine brown sugar, egg, butter, salt, vanilla, and bourbon and mix with a whisk (or mini-prep) until smooth. Remove muffin pan from the freezer. Spoon 1 teaspoon chopped pecans into each tartlet shell. Pour filling over pecans almost to the top of the shell. A squeeze bottle will vastly speed the process, but don't worry if you don't have one. Transfer the pan to the oven. Bake 15 minutes, then drop temperature to 250 and bake 10 more minutes, until crusts are lightly browned and filling in the center is just set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool to room temperature. #chouquettekitchen #pecantassies #tassies #holiday #privatechef #baking #holidaybaking #food #dessert #fyp.",

            "content": "For many newcomers, golf still feels like a distant sport that is expensive and not easily accessible. When we first came to Sudbury, we shared that same impression. But one quiet afternoon, a simple encounter changed our view completely. That was the beginning of our unexpected journey into Canada’s golf culture. Our golf journey began with simple curiosity One sunny afternoon, while walking along Marley Street, we passed a local golf shop, Pro Liquidators and Indoor Golf Centre. Out of curiosity, we stepped inside and asked if there was a trial lesson. A friendly staff member kindly invited us to try a few swings on the simulator. He patiently introduced us to the basics the club, the ball and the bag. When he found out we were newcomers, he encouraged us not to give up and to be brave enough to try. That simple act of kindness stayed with us; it felt like our first welcome card from Canada’s golf community. That brief experience sparked our interest and changed how we saw the sport. For a moment, it didn’t feel distant or out of reach what once seemed exclusive suddenly felt open and welcoming. As our curiosity grew, we wanted to learn more about the game. That’s when we met Nick Yawney, former CPGA golf professional and the manager of Pro Golf Liquidators, who guided us to Timberwolf Golf Club. Stepping onto the real grass at Timberwolf Golf Club felt like entering a whole new world of golf. Timberwolf Golf Club, well known for its 18-hole championship layout. It covers an area nearly three times the size of any other local course. Nick took us to play nine holes, which is perfect for beginners. As we moved from one hole to the next, the natural scenery took our breath away. The expansive fairways flowed gracefully through forests and wetlands, where trees and lakes weave together in perfect harmony. Although we had practiced on the simulator, walking onto the real course felt completely different. Nick took the first swing as a demonstration. With a crisp and powerful strike, the ball flew off his club and disappeared into the distance like it had wings. When it was our turn, we did all the preparations, placed the tee, gripped the driver, took our stance, and swung. Yet, the ball went off target. Nick taught us how to choose the right landing spot. “The goal isn’t to hit as far as possible,” he said, “but to decide where you want the ball to land.” He encouraged us to focus on the target and avoid hazards around the fairway, such as bunkers and water. Later that day, we also learned a small lesson in golf etiquette. We couldn’t remember which hole it was, but we hit the ball into a bunker. Nick pointed to the rake beside the bunker, reminding us to smooth the sand after playing so the next golfer would have a fair surface. Approaching the green was the most exciting moment for us. It meant we were finally close to the goal. The putter seemed simple; the hole looked so near. We gave the ball a gentle push and watched it roll slowly toward the flag. It didn’t go in, but the joy of that moment was real. As Nick said, golf mimics life. Don’t dwell on the mistake from the last hole, and don’t worry about the uncertainty of the next. Live in the moment. This game requires mindset, patience and self-discipline. Golf is challenging but rewarding. Its challenge lies not in the swing itself, but in managing one’s mindset and thoughts. Through exploring and growing comes acceptance of imperfection. That’s why, like life, golf is never perfect, but it is full of meaning. Cultural Contrast: An Elite Sport vs. A Sport for Everyone Looking back, our experience in Canada revealed a story very different from what we once knew in China. There, golf symbolizes social status and serves as a passport into elite social circles. It is often associated with luxury and most clubs are private and operate under a strict membership system. For example, Beijing has around 50 golf clubs. The initiation fees often reach several hundred thousand Canadian dollars, and for top private clubs, they can approach CAD $200,000. Even a regular course in Changping can cost CAD $25,000 just to join, and the annual fee is additional. The high cost has clear reasons behind it. Golf re-emerged after China’s economic reform in the 1980s and was mainly played by business elites. Moreover, new course construction is now restricted by government policy due to limited land resources and environmental protection concerns. As a result, there are only about 600 courses nationwide. In addition, because of high land prices and costly maintenance, each course becomes a major investment. In Canada, golf tells a very different story. Golf here is meant to be enjoyed by everyone. Across cities and small towns, public courses and driving ranges are easy to find. Most importantly, they’re affordable. “Most courses are public and affordable,” Nick told us. “You can simply call, book a tee time, and play. It’s actually one of the most played sports in Canada.” Openness is only part of the story. There is something more that makes it special. Nick highlighted what makes it truly special: Its ability to connect people across generations. “It’s a lifelong sport,” he noted. “You can play from the age of five to 80. You rarely see a father and son sharing the ice in hockey, but in golf, three generations can share the same fairway.” Surrounded by lakes and forests, Sudbury offers ideal conditions for golf. Playing golf here means spending time in nature, not just playing a sport. Nick explained that Timberwolf Golf Club is located in conservation areas. The land was originally marshland and floodplain connected to Junction Creek. In its design, the course emphasizes the natural landscape, making it look and feel more organic. He also pointed out that Canada’s vast land and open public attitude make it easier for golf and the environment to coexist in harmony. Alongside its connection with nature, golf in Canada is also about social inclusiveness. Nick said the club welcomes players from all walks of life, including many newcomers. “In the past few years, we’ve seen more newcomers from places like Nigeria and India trying golf in Sudbury,” he said. “Golf has always been strong here. We have many courses for a city of this size. I’d love to see continued community support, especially for youth and women’s golf programs.” As golf evolves, technology is reshaping how people experience the game. Simulators, now popular in both China and Canada, offer a flexible way to play year-round. In China, limited living space makes indoor golf less accessible, while in Canada, simulators thrive during the long winters and are easy to find in sports centres, golf shops and even private homes. In Sudbury, Pro Golf Liquidators offers one of the best indoor golf experiences. The difference speaks for itself here, golf is no longer a distant or unattainable sport. It’s a game that welcomes everyone, a way of life that brings people outdoors, connects them with nature, and encourages a slower, more mindful pace. As newcomers, we’ve learned not only the techniques of golf, but also the mindset of embracing nature and living more slowly and intentionally something that feels especially natural here in Sudbury, surrounded by lakes and forests. A Little Golf Quiz-Can you guess what these pictures mean? What’s inside a beginner’s golf bag? A simple package set with about nine or ten clubs is enough to start. It usually includes a driver, a hybrid, a few irons, a wedge, and a putter. Do you know how many smiles on a ball? Most golf balls have around 350 dimples, some models even exactly 365, just like days in a year. What is this tool used for? It’s a divot mix bottle, used to repair the turf after a golf shot. As newcomers to Canada and mothers, they are deeply interested in education, cultural transition and the immigrant experience. By listening and storytelling, they hope to build understanding across cultures.",

            "content": "Here’s some good news for folks wanting an update on Sony’s previously announced Helldivers feature film. Justin Lin, best known for his work on the Fast & Furious franchise, is set to direct the cinematic adaptation of PlayStation and Arrowhead’s massively popular online co-op shooter. He’ll be working alongside PlayStation Productions on the live-action adaptation, which was first announced in January 2025. The upcoming Helldivers movie has a script written by Annabelle and It writer Gary Dauberman. Justin Lin is a perfect choice for Helldivers. He has experience working on big-budget action movies, having directed The Fast And Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast & Furious 4, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, and F9: The Fast Saga. He also directed Star Trek: Beyond, the third and presumably last film in the JJ Abrams-produced modern Star Trek reboot trilogy. While the Fast movies can be over-the-top nonsense, the action and visuals within the movies are top-notch notch and each one is fast-paced. This resume feels like the perfect fit for Helldivers, especially with a solid script that leans into the absurd space-facism of the series. The Hollywood Reporter says that Lin isn’t a gamer, but used that fact to his advantage when pitching his take on Helldivers to Sony and PlayStation. He reportedly wants to focus on the humanity in the characters and feature a “timely” story as well as build up what could be a future franchise for the studio.",

            "content": "PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. Haitian families in Palm Beach County said the federal government’s decision to end Temporary Protected Status for Haitians has triggered widespread fear and uncertainty throughout the community. “We feel it in every way. In the churches, everywhere. We feel the impact of the immigration fallout,” Emmanuel Similus said. He also added, “Whether you’re directly impacted, you have a friend, or you have a friend that has a friend, so we all feel it some kind of way.” Emmanuel Similus, who owns a restaurant in Delray Beach, said even his own niece is facing an immigration deadline. “She was allowed for two years and her two years was expired,” he said. Similus said his niece is among the 300, 000 Haitians whose TPS will expire in less than 90 days. The Department of Homeland Security announced last week that TPS for Haitians will end Feb. 3, 2026, saying “Haiti no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also urged Haitian TPS holders to prepare to “depart” if they have no other legal pathway to stay in the United States. Residents said the impact will be immediate. “Their jobs are on the line. The driving is on the line. Some of these people have cars, house, you know what,” one community member said. Haitian immigration attorney Frandley Julien said families are scrambling for answers and running out of time. “People are panicking, they don’t know what to do,\" Julien said. \"We have those mixed status families where you have a U. S. citizen spouse and the other spouse is on TPS they don’t know what to do, what kind of decision they will have to come up with.” He warns that most TPS holders will have few, if any, options to remain in the country. \"For the vast majority of TPS holders, there will be no options,\" Julien said. \"We tell them they need to consult with an estate planning attorney, because you may have decisions to make.” Julien disputes the administration’s justification for ending TPS, saying conditions in Haiti have not improved. “Haiti is in worst shape today than it has ever been at any TPS designation moment,” he said. “Definitely the administration is mischaracterizing the condition on the ground.\" He said immigration advocates plan to challenge the decision in court. But for thousands of Haitian families, the uncertainty is overwhelming.",

            "content": "FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino has sought to clarify his role in the redaction of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, following the release of internal emails suggesting his involvement in limiting the disclosure of sensitive information. The revelation has placed Bongino, a vocal advocate for transparency, at odds with the administrative reality of the 'Epstein Transparency Project', a massive bureaucratic undertaking designed to screen the files before public release. Bongino's Defence and Timeline Writing on X, Bongino addressed the scrutiny surrounding the correspondence, arguing that the protocols were established prior to his tenure. However, emails obtained by Bloomberg through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request suggested that he was forwarded an email on 18 March, related to 'guidance' on the kind of redactions that would be applied to the Epstein files. 'Folks, I entered on duty on March 17th, The emails in the chain you see forwarded to me, at my request, were sent before I began in my position. I wanted to review what have been done before I entered on duty. It was a priority and as you can see, they responded immediately. I'm glad that these emails are available for your review,' said Bongino, quoting a tweet showing the screenshot of one of the emails. While Bongino emphasised the timeline, he did not elaborate on the specific criteria used to justify the extensive redactions that have frustrated transparency advocates. The 'Special Redaction Project' The documents provide a rare glimpse into the logistical scale of the FBI's review process. The emails also revealed how many hours the FBI devoted to the project, requiring some of their agents to work more hours and weekends. The operation involved comprehensive training modules, including slideshow presentations and videos on how to review the controversial files. The emails also revealed the intensity of the workload, requiring agents to work extended hours and weekends. Resource Allocation and Costs Even personnel from the counter-intelligence and international operations were tasked to be part of the project. The emails showed that they were paid $851,344 (estimated £644, 277) in overtime pay between 17 March and 22 March. Between January and July, FBI personnel clocked a total of 4, 737 hours of overtime. In one email dated 10 March, personnel from the FBI Office of General Counsel and the Information Management Division discussed pending FOIA requests for Epstein-related documents. They also discussed the digitisation and redacting of 'physical files' as well as the agency's 'commitment to transparency.' Political Friction and the 'Client List' The internal mechanics of the redaction process appear to conflict with Bongino's public posture. On 10 May, already aware of the sweeping redaction efforts, Bongino emphasised the need to go through the proper process while acknowledging the growing public calls for the release of the files. 'There are voluminous amounts of child sexual abuse material that we are dealing with. There are also victim's statements that are entitled to specific protections. We need to do this correctly, but I do understand the public's desire to get the information out there,' said Bongino in a post on X. Tensions reportedly escalated following a Department of Justice (DOJ) statement on 7 July, which asserted that there was no 'incriminating client list.' Bongino reportedly threatened to step down from his post and clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Trump administration's perceived reversal on releasing additional Epstein files.

            "content": "Scarlett Johansson has defended her support for Woody Allen after standing with the director in the wake of his daughter’s 2019 sexual abuse allegations against him. The actor, 41, reflected on the consequences of her public alliance with the controversial filmmaker, 90, in a recent interview with The Telegraph. When asked if she had lost any relationships or work opportunities over her divisive stance six years ago, Johansson told the outlet: “I guess it’s hard to know. You never know what the domino effect is, exactly.” “But my mom always encouraged me to be myself, [to see] that it’s important to have integrity, and stand up for what you believe in.” She added: “At the same time, I think it’s also important to know when it’s not your turn. I don’t mean that you should silence yourself. I mean sometimes it’s just not your time. And that’s something I’ve understood more as I’ve matured.” Johansson has starred in three movies directed by Allen: Match Point, Scoop, and Vicky Christina Barcelona. She was one of the few people in Hollywood who openly supported the director in the face of the claims against him, which he has vehemently denied since they were first made in 1992. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, the Black Widow actor told the The Hollywood Reporter in 2019: “I love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him anytime.” She added at the time, “I see Woody whenever I can, and I have had a lot of conversations with him about it. I have been very direct with him, and he’s very direct with me. He maintains his innocence, and I believe him.” Allen’s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, alleged in an open letter published in the New York Times in 2014 that the director molested her when she was seven years old during his relationship with her mom, actor Mia Farrow. Allen refuted the claims and insisted that Mia coached Dylan to accuse him of sexual abuse to get back at him following their breakup. Allen was investigated over the claims and no criminal charges were ever brought against him. While former collaborators like Diane Keaton and Javier Bardem joined Johansson in defending Allen, many A-listers publicly declared they would never work with Allen again. The allegations came in addition to Allen marrying Soon-Yi Previn, which raised eyebrows over their 35-year age gap as well as the fact that she is also Mia Farrow’s adopted daughter.",

            "content": "A US admiral acting under the authority of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a \"double-tap\" military operation that targeted survivors of an initial attack on an alleged drug smuggling boat, the White House said Monday. The legality of the Trump administration's deadly strikes against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific has already been questioned, and reports of the follow-up attack on survivors have triggered further accusations of a possible war crime. A total of 11 people were killed in the two strikes in early September, the first in a months-long military campaign that has so far left more than 80 dead. President Donald Trump's administration insists it is effectively at war with alleged \"narco-terrorists,\" and the White House said Admiral Frank Bradley, who currently leads US Special Operations Command, had acted legally and properly in ordering the second strike on the survivors. Bradley \"worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told journalists. Hegseth \"authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\" she said. US media reported last week that an initial September 2 strike left alive two people who were killed in a subsequent attack to fulfill Hegseth's orders, but Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell insisted that \"this entire narrative was false.\" Subsequent strikes that left survivors were followed by search-and-rescue efforts that recovered two people in one case and failed to find another later in October. 'Over the line' Hegseth has insisted that the strikes -- so far conducted in international waters -- are legal, saying in a recent post on X that the military action is \"in compliance with the law of armed conflict -- and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.\" However, the military action on September 2 would appear to run afoul of the Pentagon's own Law of War Manual, which states: \"For example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.\" Democratic Senators Jacky Rosen and Chris Van Hollen have said the September 2 strikes may be a war crime, while another lawmaker from the party, Senator Mark Kelly, called Monday for Congress to investigate. \"I'm concerned that if there were, in fact, as reported, survivors clinging to a damaged vessel, that that could be over a line,\" the former fighter pilot and astronaut told a news conference. Kelly was one of six lawmakers who released a video last month saying \"illegal orders\" can be refused -- a move that infuriated Trump and sparked a Pentagon probe into the \"potentially unlawful comments\" by the retired Navy officer. Trump has deployed the world's biggest aircraft and an array of other military assets to the Caribbean, insisting they are there for counter-narcotics operations. Regional tensions have flared as a result of the strikes and the military buildup, with Venezuela's leftist leader Nicolas Maduro accusing Washington of using drug trafficking as a pretext for \"imposing regime change\" in Caracas. Maduro, whose re-election last year was rejected by Washington as fraudulent, insists there is no drug cultivation in Venezuela, which he says is used as a trafficking route for Colombian cocaine against its will. wd/des.",

            "content": "A teen who was believed to have cognitive issues was mauled to death Sunday by a lioness after he snuck into the animal’s enclosure. The incident occurred at the Parque Zoobotânico Arruda Câmara in Joao Pessoa, Brazil, according to a press release shared by the zoo on Instagram. The teen “deliberately invaded the lioness’s enclosure,” according to a translation. “As soon as the incident was reported, the park was immediately closed, following all safety protocols. The teams contacted the competent authorities and provided the necessary support for the investigation and the work of the forensic team,” the zoo wrote. “We inform you that Bica will remain closed to visitors until the conclusion of the investigations and official procedures, prioritizing transparency and commitment to the safety of our visitors, employees and animals,” they continued. The zoo also expressed its condolences to the teen’s family. “Arruda Câmara Park expresses its solidarity with the family of the young man who passed away, deeply regrets the loss, and wishes them strength during this difficult time,” the zoo’s statement continued. The teen was identified as Gerson de Melo Machado, O Correio Braziliense reported. He reportedly surmounted a wall over 19 feet high to gain access to the animal’s enclosure despite security personnel responding. Verônica Oliveira, a child welfare counselor who had worked with the teen since he was 10 years old, told O Correio Braziliense he suffered from schizophrenia and had been institutionalized. “Gerson was a child who suffered all kinds of rights violations. The son of a schizophrenic mother, with grandparents also suffering from mental health issues, he lived in extreme poverty,” she said. “He was 19 years old, but when he spoke, I believe his cognitive ability was no more than that of a 5-year-old.” The teen also allegedly had run-ins with the law. He threw cobblestones at a police car in one recent incident, Oliveira told the outlet. Prior to his death, the teen dreamed of taming lions on a safari in Africa and once snuck into an aircraft’s landing gear believe it would transport him to the continent before being discovered and turned over to Child Protective Services, she said. (RELATED: Texas Hikers Catch Mountain Lion Staring Them Down In Tense Video) The lioness who mauled the teen will be watched and evaluated by a technical team in the days to come, according to Folha de S. Paulo. Oliveira said the teen’s death has caused “enormous pain in my soul,” O Correio Braziliense reported.",

The purpose of this imaging is preventative, to identify any issues early, confirm overall health, and ensure the president maintains long-term vitality and function. President Trump's cardiovascular imaging was perfectly normal. No evidence of arterial narrowing, impairing blood flow, or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels. The heart chambers are normal in size. The vessel walls appear smooth and healthy, and there are no signs of inflammation or clotting. Overall, his cardiovascular system shows excellent health. His abdominal imaging is also perfectly normal. All major organs appear very healthy and well perfused. Everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns. In summary, this level of detailed assessment is standard for an executive physical at President Trump's age, and confirms that he remains in excellent overall health.",

            "content": "All eyes were on Sienna Miller as she stepped onto the red carpet at The Fashion Awards 2025 in London tonight. Draped in a sheer white Givenchy by Sarah Burton gown-specifically, look 37 from the spring/summer 2026 collection-Miller made a bold announcement: She’s expecting her third child. The empire-waisted, floor-length mesh dress revealed her baby bump beneath. She finished her red carpet maternity look with pearl pendant earrings and furry pink sandals, both also by Givenchy. The Fashion Awards, historically known as the British Fashion Awards before its 2016 rebrand, has spotlighted decades of fashion’s most influential designers and innovators since its inception in 1989. This year’s ceremony, held at London’s Royal Albert Hall, featured a strong contingent of nominees, ranging from established names to rising talents. The 2025 British Womenswear Designer of the Year winner was Sarah Burton for Givenchy. Simone Rocha, Chopova Lowena, Charlotte Knowles for Knwls, and Erdem Moralıoğlu were also nominated.

            "content": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt decided to bring back one of Donald Trump’s pet phrases from his first term in office, only to be mocked on social media by people amused she didn’t notice the irony of her plans. On Monday, Leavitt said on social media that the administration is launching a “Media Offender of the Week” section on the White House website to call out “fake news,” which, you might remember, is a phrase Trump has been known to use to describe accurate journalism about him that he doesn’t like. Leavitt made things worse for herself when she made a comment to reporters about all “the fake news that we see pumped out of this building on a day to day basis.” Considering that Trump is a habitual liar, many people on social media found Leavitt’s rant against “fake news” dripping with irony. Not surprisingly, Leavitt’s gaffe was mocked on social media. Leavitt is just the latest Republican who has made a seemingly truthful statement unintentionally. Back in September, Sen. Ted Cruz said rhetorically during a committee hearing, “How about we all come together and say, ‘Let’s stop attacking pedophiles.’” In October, House Speaker Mike Johnson declared his party was anti-Nazi, but misspoke by saying, “We defended that evil ideology.” Related.

            "content": "Polls show that the age-group of Americans most worried about “affordability” are the 20 and 30 somethings. That’s young millennials and the Gen Z generation. Why are they so financially stressed out? One reason things seem so unaffordable to young people is that too many aren’t working hard. They are hardly working. The latest Labor Department data indicate that fewer and fewer males between the ages of 16-24 are in the labor force. It used to be that more than 70% had a job, and now it is less than 60%. (RELATED: Most Voters Think Trump Neglecting Economy, Inflation, Poll Shows) Labor force participation for men even into their 30s is at or near an all-time low. Men without jobs are a prescription for social chaos. I would argue this is the MOST important age for men to be hard at work, honing their job skills, and on the way to a career that makes them a suitable marriage partner. Marriage rates for young men are down as well. Their lack of work experience and a successful career trajectory is one major reason why. The earlier in life that men (and women) start working, the more successful they are likely to be in their careers and their lifetime earnings. Getting young people in the workforce is critical to solving so many of our societal problems. How can tuition, groceries, health care and housing be affordable when so many aren’t earning a paycheck? To solve this problem will require a societal/cultural shift. Parents need to encourage their high school and especially college kids to be working 10 to 20 hours a week. Watching TV and playing computer games or even being a bookworm is no path to success. Every city and state should have a teen minimum wage of no more than $5 an hour. The skills that one earns on their first job are invaluable later in life. We need a new ethic that every college student should be working up to 20 hours a week while they are in school in lieu of taking out as much as $100,000 in loans subsidized by taxpayers. This is a win-win for everyone: Colleges would have to lower their outrageous tuition fees. Kids would learn real life skills while in school. And we could eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars of student loan debt that is often defaulted on. The college student loan program should be eliminated and replaced by a student work program. I have long touted the College of the Ozarks model where the tuition is free, but every student pays for college by working 20 hours a week at a job learning life skills. These are some of the most impressive students I’ve met in my visits to dozens of top universities. If the kids pay for the tuition themselves, they value it far more. As the old saying goes, anything easily attained is lightly regarded. This would also be a good way to get rid of the snowflake mentality where college kids sit in their “safe spaces” and act as though they have a constitutional right to never be offended. With a job they will be quickly disabused of that idea the first time they show up for work and get chewed out by their boss. Work is hard. Work pays the bills. Work is a virtue. The earlier in life kids learn that lesson, the better for them and all of us. The one thing that college students have plenty of is time. We know this from the epidemic of “social activism” on campus. Kids won’t have the luxury of protesting on the streets about the temperature of the planet 50 or 100 years from now if they are working.

However, by late Tuesday, model guidance suggests a deterioration in weather conditions due to a more favorable mid to upper level atmosphere. As a result, shower activity is expected to increase in frequency and intensity, with pockets of heavy showers and thunderstorms anticipated into late Wednesday. Advisories may be issued for SVG. Improved weather, with only a few showers, should return by Thursday. 15-25km/h easterly to east-northeasterly winds will persist across the islands, becoming strong (~40km/h) with higher gusts by midweek, and shifting east- southeasterly. Seas are slight to moderate in open waters, with swells peaking near 1. 0m on the western coast and 1. 5m on the eastern coasts. Gusty winds could agitate seas from Tuesday night, resulting in deteriorating sea conditions. Small-craft operators and sea bathers should exercise extreme caution for above normal swells and occasional gusty winds.",

North Yorkshire Police said it is investigating the collision involving a white Mercedes Sprinter minibus and a Hyundai i10 car on Toulston Lane in Tadcaster at around 12. 30pm on Monday. The girl who died at the scene was a passenger on the minibus which was carrying nine teenagers aged 16 to 18, the force said. Another teenage girl was taken to hospital with serious injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening. The other passengers and the man driving the minibus were left with minor injuries, police said. The crash took place close to Tadcaster Grammar School. According to the BBC, the school sent a message to parents saying it would be closed on Tuesday as the site “will not be safe for students”. The driver of the Hyundai, a 40-year-old woman, has been arrested in connection with the investigation, the force added. Police are appealing for witness and anyone with dashcam footage.",

The 25-year-old man who died after an incident in Norwood Saturday actually sustained injuries from a sharp object, not a gunshot wound, officials said. Anton C. Dowling, of Boston, was identified as the man who died at a Needham hospital from what emergency room doctors initially believed to be a gunshot wound, the Norfolk County District Attorney said in a release. An autopsy showed he instead died from injuries sustained from a sharp object, the DA said. Norwood police responded to the area of 9 Hoyle St. around 2 p. m. Saturday after a 911 call came in “requesting assistance,” the DA said. Dowling was found with injuries and transported to a Needham hospital. At the time, Norwood Police Chief Christopher Padden said there was no threat to the public. The investigation is active and ongoing, the DA said Monday, previously adding that Massachusetts State Police assigned to the DA’s office will work with Norwood police to investigate.",

Real estate sources tell TMZ . Russell, the billionaire behind Rockstar Energy drinks, bought a home near Mark in Delray Beach's Stone Creek Ranch for $18,005,000. Here's what $19 million, give or take, gets you in a small neighborhood known locally as \"Billionaire's Row\" . 11, 506 square feet with 7 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms nestled up to a manmade lake. The home comes with all the bells and whistles, including a 76-foot heated saltwater pool, an oversize spa, full-sized tennis and basketball courts, a cabana house, an in-ground trampoline, and a sunken fire lounge for 20 guests. Russell previously spent $35. 3 million for Rosie O'Donnell's former estate on Star Island in Miami -- where Diddy owns a home -- but the big selling point for Stone Creek Ranch is privacy and being off the water. The gated enclave only has 37 compounds, and residents get guarded entrances with round-the-clock armed security. The guards are all ex-cops and ex-military. TMZ. com Check out the gallery . no wonder billionaires are moving into Stone Creek Ranch.",
